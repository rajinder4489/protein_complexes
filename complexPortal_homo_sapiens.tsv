The precise process is undefined but the complex appears to reduce the superhelicity of the promoter region DNA around nucleosomes and may produce short DNA loops that are detached from the the nucleosomes, enabling access to the promoter region for a range of transcription factors and the pre-initiation complex (PIC). The complex also plays a role in double-strand break and nucleotide excision repair mechanisms and in the decatenation of newly replicated sister chromatids, a requirement for proper chromosome segregation during mitosis. Also targeted to chromatin by phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate which promotes the complex binding to actin filaments. The complex additionally interacts with a range of nuclear receptors and the vitamin D receptor (VDR, P11473) via SMARCD subunits. pBAF complexes facilitate the ligand-dependant transcriptional activation of target genes by nuclear hormone receptors and regulates cell differentiation, esp. in cardiac development. Acts as transcriptional repressor of neuronal genes in non-neuronal cells by interacting with the REST repressor complex and histone deacetylases (HDACs). The SWI/SNF complexes have been reported as consisting of 8 to 14 subunits. pBAF exists in two variants, containing either ACTL6A (this complex) or ACTL6B (CPX-1196) subunit. Subunit BRD7 may be restricted to pBAF complexes in embryonic stem cells and not present in differentiated cells. The alternative ATPase, SMARCA2/BRM (P51531), does not occur in the pBAF complexes. SMARCD1 (BAF60A) and SMARCD2 (BAF60B) may not co-occur. It is not clear if BCL7A (Q4VC05), BCL7B (Q9BQE9), BCL7C (Q8WUZ0) or SMARCD3 (Q6STE5) are part of any pBAF variants. Mutations in several subunits affect tissue and developmental processes such as nervous system and cardiac development and maintenance of pluripotency resulting in tumorigenesis or the development of intellectual disorders. 	MW approximately 2 MDa. May contain 2 instances of each subunit as calculated total MW for all subunits is approximately1 MDa. While the complex is recruited to chromatin by lineage-specific transcription factors it also binds directly to the DNA via several of its subunits, such as SMARCB1 and SMARCE1. SMARCE1 also has DNA binding-bending activity. 	-	-	Coffin-Siris syndrome (CSS) [Orphanet:1465]: a rare congenital multi-systemic genetic disorder characterized by aplasia or hypoplasia of the distal phalanx or nail of the fifth digit, developmental delay, intellectual disability, coarse facial features, and other variable clinical manifestations.|Intellectual disability-sparse hair-brachydactyly syndrome [Orphanet:3051]: a very rare condition of unknown etiology consisting of short stature, hypotrichosis, brachydactyly with cone-shaped epiphyses, epilepsy and severe mental delay.

The complex additionally interacts with a range of nuclear receptors and the vitamin D receptor (VDR, P11473) via SMARCD subunits. The neural progenitor-specific SWI/SNF complex is critical for self-renewal, maintenance and pluripotency of neural progenitor stem cells by selectively activating or repressing its target genes. In this variant of the complex transcriptional repression is probably driven by the presence of the ARID1A subunit. During neural development a switch from a progenitor to a post-mitotic chromatin remodeling mechanism occurs as neurons exit the cell cycle and become committed to their adult state. This process requires a switch of two subunits: ACTL6A is replaced by ACTL6B (O94805) and PHF10 replaced by DPF1 (Q92782) or DPF3 (Q92784) in neuron-specific SWI/SNF complexes. The SWI/SNF complexes have been reported as consisting of 8 to 14 subunits. Although similar in function to the embryonic stem cell-specific SWI/SNF complex the composition of the neural progenitor-specific SWI/SNF complexes is more similar to the standard SWI/SNF complexes. It is likely that the two ATPases, SMARCA2/BRM (this complex) and SMARCA4/BRG1 (CPX-1212) do not co-occur in the same complex. SMARCD1 (BAF60A) and SMARCD3 (BAF60C) also may not co-occur. It is not clear yet if DPF2/BAF45D (Q92785) is a member of the neural progenitor-specific SWI/SNF complex.

The precise process is undefined but the complex appears to reduce the superhelicity of the promoter region DNA around nucleosomes and may produce short DNA loops that are detached from the the nucleosomes, enabling access to the promoter region for a range of transcription factors and the pre-initiation complex (PIC). The complex also plays a role in double-strand break and nucleotide excision repair mechanisms and in the decatenation of newly replicated sister chromatids, a requirement for proper chromosome segregation during mitosis. Also targeted to chromatin by phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate which promotes the complex binding to actin filaments. The complex additionally interacts with a range of nuclear receptors and the vitamin D receptor (VDR, P11473) via SMARCD subunits. SWI/SNF complexes containing DPF3 are specific to muscle cells where they play an essential role in the development of heart and skeletal muscle cells. Also found in brown adipocytes where they regulate gene-expression of brown fat-selective genes. Acts as transcriptional repressor of neuronal genes in non-neuronal cells by interacting with the REST repressor complex and histone deacetylases (HDACs). In this variant of the complex transcriptional repression is probably driven by the presence of the ARID1A subunit. The SWI/SNF complexes have been reported as consisting of 8 to 14 subunits. It is likely that the two ATPases, SMARCA2/BRM (CPX-1225) and SMARCA4/BRG1 (this complex) do not co-occur in the same complex. SMARCD1 (BAF60A) and SMARCD2 (BAF60B) also may not co-occur. The following proteins may be associated with SWI/SNF (BAF) complex variants, with one or more from each family present in any given complex: DPF2/BAF45D (Q92785), BRD9 (Q9H8M2), SS18 (Q15532), BCL11A (Q9H165), BCL11B (Q9C0K0), BCL7A (Q4VC05), BCL7B (Q9BQE9), BCL7C (Q8WUZ0). Mutations in several subunits affect tissue and developmental processes such as nervous system and cardiac development and maintenance of pluripotency resulting in tumorigenesis or the development of intellectual disorders. 	MW approximately 2 MDa. May contain 2 instances of each subunit as calculated total MW for all subunits is approximately 1 MDa. While the complex is recruited to chromatin by lineage-specific transcription factors it also binds directly to the DNA via several of its subunits, such as ARID1A, SMARCB1 and SMARCE1. SMARCE1 also has DNA binding-bending activity. DPF3 specifically binds acetylated histones 3 and 4: H3K14ac, H3K9ac, H4K5ac, h4K8ac, H4K12ac and H4K16ac.	-	-	Coffin-Siris syndrome (CSS) [Orphanet:1465]: a rare congenital multi-systemic genetic disorder characterized by aplasia or hypoplasia of the distal phalanx or nail of the fifth digit, developmental delay, intellectual disability, coarse facial features, and other variable clinical manifestations.|Intellectual disability-sparse hair-brachydactyly syndrome [Orphanet:3051]: a very rare condition of unknown etiology consisting of short stature, hypotrichosis, brachydactyly with cone-shaped epiphyses, epilepsy and severe mental delay.

Ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase pumps protons into the intermembrane space, creating an electrochemical gradient. This is achieved by oxidizing ubiquinol (ubihydroquinone) which reacts from the membrane phase, reducing cytochrome c in the intermembrane space, and using the free energy change to transport H+ ions across the membrane from the matrix to the inter membrane space. Quinol oxidation occurs in a bifurcated reaction, in which one electron is transferred to a high potential chain and the other to a low potential chain. The high potential chain, consisting of the iron sulfur protein, cyt c1 and cyt c2, transfers the first electron from quinol to an acceptor (cytochrome oxidase). The low potential chain consists of two cyt b hemes, which serve as a pathway through which electrons are transferred across the coupling membrane.

DFSP can present at any age, including infancy and childhood, but usually presents in the 2nd to 5th decade of life. Between 85 and 90% of tumors are low grade lesions, with the remainder classified as the high grade fibrosarcomatous (FS) type. The lesions typically present as an indurated pink or violet-red plaque or nodular mass on the trunk, proximal extremities, or head and neck region. Growth tends to be slow with local infiltration into deeper tissues and a propensity for local recurrence after excision. However, metastases are rare. Occurrence is sporadic.|Bilateral striopallidodentate calcinosis (Idiopathic basal ganglia calcification) [Orphanet:1980]: Bilateral striopallidodentate calcinosis (BSPDC, also erroneously called Fahr disease) is characterized by the accumulation of calcium deposits in different brain regions, particularly the basal ganglia and dentate nucleus, and is often associated with neurodegeneration.	-	-	-	psi-mi:"MI:0469"(IntAct)

Additional features may include headache, seizures, gradual personality changes (apathy and dementia), anosmia, impaired vision, exophthalmos, hearing loss, ataxia, dysmetria, hypotonia, nystagmus, and rarely spontaneous bleeding.|Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP) [Orphanet:31112]: a rare infiltrating soft tissue sarcoma, generally of low grade malignancy, arising from the dermis of the skin and characteristically associated with a specific chromosomal translocation t(17;22). DFSP can present at any age, including infancy and childhood, but usually presents in the 2nd to 5th decade of life. Between 85 and 90% of tumors are low grade lesions, with the remainder classified as the high grade fibrosarcomatous (FS) type. The lesions typically present as an indurated pink or violet-red plaque or nodular mass on the trunk, proximal extremities, or head and neck region. Growth tends to be slow with local infiltration into deeper tissues and a propensity for local recurrence after excision. However, metastases are rare. Occurrence is sporadic.|Bilateral striopallidodentate calcinosis (Idiopathic basal ganglia calcification) [Orphanet:1980]: Bilateral striopallidodentate calcinosis (BSPDC, also erroneously called Fahr disease) is characterized by the accumulation of calcium deposits in different brain regions, particularly the basal ganglia and dentate nucleus, and is often associated with neurodegeneration.	-	-	-	psi-mi:"MI:0469"(IntAct)

In the presence of calcium, the C1q complex (CPX-1919) associates with the C1S-C1R-C1R-C1S tetramer. When C1q binds to an activating target, a conformational change triggers the auto-activation of the associated C1R protease (converting the pro-enzyme into an activated form), which activates C1S. C1S then cleaves the Arg-|-Ala bond in complement component C4 to form C4a and C4b, and the Lys(or Arg)-|-Lys bond in complement component C2 to form C2a and C2b which in turn form C3 convertase complexes C4bC2a-A (CPX-5675) and C4bC2a-B. 	2xC1R-2xC1S adopts an extended structure in solution in which the two C1R-C1S dimers are linked by a central interaction between the catalytic domains of C1R.

The complex's role in C1 is the recognition of immune complexes, or other molecules, which trigger the classical pathway of the complement system. Independent of complement activation C1q appears to have additional roles in homeostasis and cellular development, superoxide (O2-) production by neutrophils, blood coagulation and neurological synapse pruning. 	The complex comprises of six heterotrimeric collagen-like triple helices, formed from triplets of the A, B, and C chains, that associate in their N-terminal half to form a stalk, then diverge to form individual stems, each terminating in a C-terminal globular domain. Each of the six heterotrimeric globular heads or domains is made up of the globular domains from one A, one B, and one C chain, each of which in turn has its own ligand specificity. The six collagen-like stalks appear to be fibril-like and exist in the central region. The collagen-like region and the globular heads can independently interact with a multiplicity of biological structures including pathogen-associated and cell associated molecules, also each of the individual globular head domains is capable of independently interacting with specific ligands. Chains A and B are disulfide-linked whilst the C chain forms a disulfide bond with the C chain of the next strand. Molecular weight 460 kDa.

The BBSome complex is required for ciliogenesis but is dispensable for centriolar satellite function. This ciliogenic function is mediated in part by the Rab8 GDP/GTP exchange factor (P61006/Q92930), which localizes to the basal body and contacts the BBSome. RAB8(GTP) enters the primary cilium and promotes extension of the ciliary membrane. Firstly the BBSome associates with the ciliary membrane and binds to RAB3IP/RABIN8, the guanosyl exchange factor (GEF) for RAB8 and then the RAB8-GTP localizes to the cilium and promotes docking and fusion of carrier vesicles to the base of the ciliary membrane. The BBSome complex, together with the LTZL1, controls SMO ciliary trafficking and contributes to the sonic hedgehog pathway regulation.	The apparent molecular weight of the BBSome (438 kDa) calculated from its measured Stokes radius (78 A) and sedimentation coefficient (14 S) is in close agreement with its predicted molecular weight of 470 kDa.	-	-	Ciliopathy [EFO:0003900]: Ciliary dysfunction leads to a broad spectrum of disorders, collectively termed ciliopathies.

Deposited by spliceosomes at a conserved position of a pre-messenger RNA strand located upstream of exon junctions formed during RNA splicing. The EJC remains stably bound at this position as the mature messenger ribonucleoprotein particle is exported to the cytoplasm, potentially promoting export through its close association with the TREX complex. Binds RNA primarily through EIF4A3, a sequence-independent DEAD box protein that grasps RNA stably only when associated with its partners, RBM8A/Y14 and MAGOH which inhibit the DEAD-box protein EIF4A3 ATPase activity, trapping the ATP-bound EJC core onto spliced mRNA in a stable conformation. The EJC core serves as a binding platform for additional factors which together then interface with numerous machineries controlling mRNA export, translation, and decay. Discriminates between premature and normal translation termination events by providing architectural information regarding the position of (former) introns. When translation terminates on an mRNA upstream of at least one EJC, UPF3 (Q9H1J1/Q9BZI7) and its cofactors UPF1 (Q9H1J1) and UPF2 (Q9HAU5) orchestrate a series of events that destabilize the message by a process known as nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD). Also enhances translation of newly synthesized mRNAs through interactions between POLDIP3 (Q9BY77) and activated S6-kinase.	The EJC structure resembles an L-shaped molecule structurally divided into two binary complexes EIF4A3-Btz at the base of the assembly and MAGOH-Y14 arranged almost perpendicularly to it. The alpha-helical surface of MAGOH interacts with the beta-sheet surface of the RNA binding domain of Y14. The domain organization of EIF4A3 is typical of the DEAD-box family of proteins, with two RecA-like domains that are arranged to form a deep interdomain cleft where ATP binds. Single-stranded RNA binds with an overall bent conformation in a shallow cleft across the two RecA-like domains and is flanked on one side by Btz.

Following the depolarization of the transverse tubule (T-tubule) membrane, RyR2 opening releases Ca2+ stored in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) into the myoplasm. This increase of cytoplasmic Ca2+ triggers the interaction of actin and myosin that causes contraction of the cardiac muscle fibers. The E-C coupling in cardiac muscle involves RyR2 calcium release triggered by Ca2+ influx due to activation of the L-type calcium channel Cav1.2 (CPX-3195). RyR2 is required for heart development. Aberrant channel activation can lead to cardiac arrhythmia. RyR2 is also shown to play a role in beta cell survival in vitro. RyR2 physically interacts with various other proteins, small molecules and ions that modulate its activity: Low Ca+2 concentration activates RyR2, by binding to specific high-affinity Ca+2 sites. High Ca+2 concentration inhibits RyR2, by binding to less specific low-affinity Ca+2 sites. PKA binds to RyR2 altering the gating. S100A1 binding enhances the open probability of RyR2. ASPH and ATP stimulates RyR2 channel activity. Magnesium ions (Mg+2) inhibits the RyR2 channel activity. Homer-1c binding inhibits RyR2 channel opening. Calmodulin binding may inhibit open basal probability and alter the Ca-dependent activation of RyR2. FKBP binding is believed to physically stabilize the coordinated gating of the four RyRs in one RyR homotetramer and may be involved in the physical coupling between RyR tetramers. Binding to sorcin decreases open channel probability. CaMKIId binds and phosphorylates RyR2 strongly activating Ca2+ release during both diastole and systole.	The functional form of the Ryr2 calcium channel is a 30 S homotetramer of negatively charged and cooperatively coupled subunits of high molecular weight. MW (tetramer) > 2MDa The calcium release channel activity resides in the C-terminal region while the remaining part of the protein constitutes the foot structure spanning the junctional gap between the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) and the T-tubule.

The large cytoplasmic domain is the site of interactions with a large number of the modulators of channel activity. Specifically, the corners of the cytoplasmic area, also called clamps, are the sites of interactions with modulators. RyRs are arrayed in the SR and the clamps are likely to participate in intermolecular interactions with neighbouring RyRs. The large cytoplasmic domain is also the site of mutations that underlie the RyR channelopathies.

Linked via G-proteins to potassium channels. Ligand binding causes a conformation change that triggers signaling via guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins) and modulates the activity of down-stream effectors, such as adenylate cyclase. Signaling inhibits adenylate cyclase, stimulates phospholipase A2, activates potassium channels, inactivates voltage-dependent calcium-channels and modulates inositol phospholipid hydrolysis. Calcium is required for high affinity binding to GABA. Plays a critical role in the fine-tuning of inhibitory synaptic transmission. Pre-synaptic GABA receptor inhibits neurotransmitter release by down-regulating high-voltage activated calcium channels, whereas postsynaptic GABA receptor decreases neuronal excitability by activating a prominent inwardly rectifying potassium (Kir) conductance that underlies the late inhibitory postsynaptic potentials. Not only implicated in synaptic inhibition but also in hippocampal long-term potentiation, slow wave sleep, muscle relaxation and antinociception.	In the apo state and antagonist-bound state the two subunits only bind via their respective LB1 domains keeping the dimer in the open, inactive conformation. Antagonists bind almost exclusively to the LB1 domain of the GABBR1 subunit. In contrast, agonist binding occurs between the LB1 and LB2 domains of the GABBR1 subunit. It induces large conformational changes in the dimer resulting in domain closure of the ligand binding site of GABBR1 and inter-subunit binding via both, the LB1 and LB2 domains of either subunit. GABBR1 residues Trp65 and His170 are indispensible for ligand binding while Tyr250 and Trp278 are critical for agonist binding only. GABBR2 mediates coupling to G proteins probably via the linker region between the transmembrane domain 3 (TM3) and the transmembrane domain 4 (TM4).

This increase of cytoplasmic Ca2+ triggers the interaction of actin and myosin that causes contraction of the muscle fibers. Implicated in skeletal muscle development, ossification, dermatogenesis and cardiovascular development. Expressed in the brain, where it can mediate the NO-induced release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores in neurons. The E-C coupling involves the mechanical interaction between RyR1 in the SR and DHPR (also known as L-type Ca2+ channel, CPX-3192) in the T-tubule. There is some evidence to suggest that this happens through the direct physical interaction of the two channels. FKBP12 binds and co-purifies with RyR1, but the intrinsic isomerase activity is not essential for RyR effects. FKBP is believed to physically stabilize the coordinated gating of the four RyRs in one RyR homotetramer and may be involved in the physical coupling between RyR tetramers. RyR1 physically interacts with various other proteins, small molecules and ions that modulate its activity: Low Ca+2 concentration activates RyR1, by binding to specific high-affinity Ca+2 sites. High Ca+2 concentration inhibits RyR1, by binding to less specific low-affinity Ca+2 sites.

The disease can be classified into clinical subtypes of increasing severity: silent alpha thalassemia, alpha thalassemia trait (or alpha thalassemia minor), hemoglobin H disease (HbH, [Orphanet:93616]), and Hb Bart's hydrops fetalis [Orphanet:163596]. A rare form called alpha-thalassemia-intellectual deficit syndrome linked to chromosome 16 (16p13.3) has also been identified. Alpha thalassemia trait causes microcytosis and hypochromia with absent or mild anemia (often detected on routine blood tests), generally with no other symptoms. HbH patients develop moderate hemolytic anemia with variable amounts of HbH along with occasionally severe splenomegaly, sometimes complicated by hypersplenism. Hb Bart's hydrops fetalis involves a severe deficiency in alpha-globin with serious developmental implications. Alpha-thalassemia-intellectual deficit syndrome is characterized by very mild to severe anemia associated with developmental abnormalities.	-	-	-	psi-mi:"MI:0469"(IntAct)

Three main types of BT have been described (minor, intermedia [Orphanet:231222] and major [Orphanet:231214]). 1) Thalassemia minor (BT-minor, BT trait) is the heterozygous form and is usually asymptomatic. 2) Thalassemia major (Cooley anemia; BT-major) is the homozygous form and associates splenomegaly and microcytic and hypochromic anemia resulting from dyserythropoiesis and hemolysis. Onset generally occurs from 6-24 months of age. Patients require regular transfusions. 3) Thalassemia intermedia (BTI) in which the anemia is less severe and diagnosed later in life compared to BT-major. Patients with BTI may or may not require occasional transfusions. Rare autosomal dominant forms have also been described (dominant beta-thalassemia [Orphanet:231226]) resulting in moderate to severe anemia. Transmission is autosomal recessive and around 200 mutations (B0 or B+) have been identified.|Sickle cell anemia [Orphanet:232]: a chronic hemolytic diseases that may induce three types of acute accidents: severe anemia, severe bacterial infections, and ischemic vasoocclusive accidents (VOA) caused by sickle-shaped red blood cells obstructing small blood vessels and capillaries. The presence of fetal hemoglobin means that the disease doesn't manifest until after 3 months. In addition to anemia and bacterial infections, VOAs cause hyperalgic focal ischemia (and sometimes infarction) when they occur in the muscles or skeleton. Over the course of time, VOAs may compromise the integrity of tissues or organs. Transmission is autosomal recessive. Sickle cell anemia is determined by combinations of two abnormal alleles of the beta globin gene among which at least one carries the beta 6 glu-val mutation (Hb S). Sickle cell anemia reduces the susceptibility to malaria infection.	-	-	-	psi-mi:"MI:0469"(IntAct)

It relays an excitatory depolarization in the t-tubular membrane to the calcium release channel in the sarcoplasmatic membrane. More specifically, rapid depolarization-induced conformational changes of DHPR stimulate calcium efflux from the sarcoplasmatic reticulum (SR) through the calcium release channel (CRC, or ryanodine receptor, RyR, CPX-3156), which subsequently trigger the contractile apparatus until the calcium concentration is reduced again due to re-uptake into the SR by the Ca2+-ATPase (Serca1). Expressed in cardiac muscle, smooth muscle (blood vessels, intestine, lung and uterus), endocrine cells (pancreatic beta cells, pituitary) and neurons (preferentially somatodendritic).	Total molecular mass of 540 kDa. Multisubunit complex formed by the alpha-1C subunit, in association with the soluble beta polypeptide, localized to the intracellular side of the plasma membrane and a largely extracellular alpha2/delta subunit. The complex is comprised of two distinct portions, a heart-shaped body and a 'finger' domain extending from a density at the tip ('nose') of the body domain. The channel activity is directed by the pore-forming and voltage-sensitive alpha-1 subunit. Alpha1C subunit consists of four conserved domains (I-IV) with six transmembrane segments (S1-S6) each. These domains are thought to be arranged in a pseudo-tetrameric structure. The S4 segment serves as the voltage sensor. The pore loop between transmembrane segments S5 and S6 in each domain determines ion conductance and selectivity. The alpha1 subunit I–II loop and alpha interaction domain (AID) interacts directly with the beta subunit, which is located on the intracellular side of the channel, facing the ryanodine receptor (RyR) complexes (RyR2: CPX-3156). The beta subunit has a role in regulating activation, inactivation and voltage-dependence as well as targeting the alpha 1C domain to the plasma membrane. The alpha 2 and delta 1 subunits are two proteolytic fragments of one polypeptide coded by the same gene, which are linked together with a disulpide bond to produce the alpha 2/delta subunit of the Cav1.2 channel. The small delta subunit consists of a single membrane-spanning helix. Calmodulin binds to the Q motif of alpha1C subunit and acts as a Ca2+ sensor. Ca(2+)/CaM mediates a negative feedback regulation of the channel. CaBP1 eliminates this action of CaM through a poorly understood mechanism.

In response to TGF-beta/activin-family protein binding, TGF-beta type II receptors phosphorylate TGF-beta type I receptors (ALK4, 5 and 7) which in turn phosphorylates SMAD2 on two Ser-465 and Ser-467. This enables binding to SMAD4 to form heteromeric SMAD complexes that enter the nucleus to initiate gene transcription. Because of their relatively low DNA-binding affinity, SMAD complexes interact with a wide variety of DNA-binding proteins, crosstalk with other signalling pathways and interaction with other DNA-binding cofactors define the specific binding patterns of SMADs; in addition, interaction with coactivators/corepressors modulates their transcriptional activity.	Preferential formation of the regulatory R-Smad/SMAD4 heterotrimer over the R-Smad homotrimer is largely enthalpy driven, contributed by the unique presence of strong electrostatic interactions within the heterotrimeric interfaces. These electrostatic interactions exist only in the heterotrimer due to specific charged residues in the SMAD4 subunit, Asp-493 and Arg-378, mediating complementary electrostatic interactions with the neighbouring R-Smad subunits.

The Mediator complex is also targeted by sequence-specific, DNA-binding transcription factors and appears to regulate RNAPII at both the initiation and elongation stages of transcription. The Mediator complex, having a compact conformation in its free form, is recruited to promoters by direct interactions with regulatory proteins and unfolds to an extended conformation and partially surrounds RNAPII specifically interacting with the unphosphorylated form of its C-terminal domain. The Mediator complex dissociates from the RNA polymerase II holoenzyme and stays at the promoter when transcriptional elongation begins. Reversibly associates with the CKM complex (CPX-3232, CPX-3263). Mediator lacking the CKM complex has a stimulatory effect on basal transcription. In contrast, Mediator containing the sub-complex represses basal transcription.	Molecular weight = >1 MDa.

Three main types of BT have been described (minor, intermedia [Orphanet:231222] and major [Orphanet:231214]). 1) Thalassemia minor (BT-minor, BT trait) is the heterozygous form and is usually asymptomatic. 2) Thalassemia major (Cooley anemia; BT-major) is the homozygous form and associates splenomegaly and microcytic and hypochromic anemia resulting from dyserythropoiesis and hemolysis. Onset generally occurs from 6-24 months of age. Patients require regular transfusions. 3) Thalassemia intermedia (BTI) in which the anemia is less severe and diagnosed later in life compared to BT-major. Patients with BTI may or may not require occasional transfusions. Rare autosomal dominant forms have also been described (dominant beta-thalassemia [Orphanet:231226]) resulting in moderate to severe anemia. Transmission is autosomal recessive and around 200 mutations (B0 or B+) have been identified.|Sickle cell anemia [Orphanet:232]: a chronic hemolytic diseases that may induce three types of acute accidents: severe anemia, severe bacterial infections, and ischemic vasoocclusive accidents (VOA) caused by sickle-shaped red blood cells obstructing small blood vessels and capillaries. The presence of fetal hemoglobin means that the disease doesn't manifest until after 3 months. In addition to anemia and bacterial infections, VOAs cause hyperalgic focal ischemia (and sometimes infarction) when they occur in the muscles or skeleton. Over the course of time, VOAs may compromise the integrity of tissues or organs. Transmission is autosomal recessive. Sickle cell anemia is determined by combinations of two abnormal alleles of the beta globin gene among which at least one carries the beta 6 glu-val mutation (Hb S). Sickle cell anemia reduces the susceptibility to malaria infection.|Alpha-thalassemia [Orphanet:846]: Alpha-thalassemia is an inherited hemoglobinopathy characterized by impaired synthesis of alpha-globin chains leading to a variable clinical picture depending on the number of affected alleles. The disease can be classified into clinical subtypes of increasing severity: silent alpha thalassemia, alpha thalassemia trait (or alpha thalassemia minor), hemoglobin H disease (HbH, [Orphanet:93616]), and Hb Bart's hydrops fetalis [Orphanet:163596]. A rare form called alpha-thalassemia-intellectual deficit syndrome linked to chromosome 16 (16p13.3) has also been identified. Alpha thalassemia trait causes microcytosis and hypochromia with absent or mild anemia (often detected on routine blood tests), generally with no other symptoms. HbH patients develop moderate hemolytic anemia with variable amounts of HbH along with occasionally severe splenomegaly, sometimes complicated by hypersplenism.

It relays an excitatory depolarization in the T-tubular membrane to the calcium release channel in the sarcoplasmatic membrane. More specifically, rapid depolarization-induced conformational changes of DHPR stimulate calcium efflux from the sarcoplasmatic reticulum (SR) through the calcium release channel (CRC, or ryanodine receptor, RyR [RyR1: CPX-3135, RyR3: CPX-3162]), which subsequently trigger the contractile apparatus until the calcium concentration is reduced again due to re-uptake into the SR by the Ca2+-ATPase (Serca1). Small calcium currents through the DHPR are activated slowly and are not sufficient to trigger muscle contraction in skeletal muscle. It is widely accepted that physical coupling accounts for the close functional coupling between the DHPR and the RyR in skeletal muscle. So far the exact mechanism of EC coupling is not fully understood.	Total molecular mass ~ 550 kDa. Multisubunit complex formed by the alpha-1C subunit, in association with the soluble beta polypeptide, localized to the intracellular side of the plasma membrane, a largely extracellular alpha2/delta subunit on the T-tubule side of the channel and an intracellular gamma subunit. The channel activity is directed by the pore-forming and voltage-sensitive alpha-1 subunit. Alpha1C subunit consists of four conserved domains (I-IV) with six transmembrane segments (S1-S6) each. These domains are thought to be arranged in a pseudo-tetrameric structure. The S4 segment serves as the voltage sensor. The pore loop between transmembrane segments S5 and S6 in each domain determines ion conductance and selectivity. The alpha1 subunit I–II loop and alpha interaction domain (AID) interacts directly with the beta subunit, which is located on the intracellular side of the channel facing the ryanodine receptor (RyR) complexes (RyR1: CPX-3135, RyR3:CPX-3162). The alpha2 and delta subunits are linked by a disulphide bridge and the small delta subunit consists of a single membrane-spanning helix. The gamma subunit is membrane-embedded and can either be located in the small or in the large sub-volume of the globular domain. The gamma1 subunit has been shown to associate with the alpha1 subunit in recent co-sedimentation experiments. The complex contains a globular domain in the shape of an ellipsoid and a protrusion that is leg-shaped and attached off-center on one of the flat sides of the globular domain. The protrusion is identified as the alpha2 subunit.	Heteropentamer	-	Malignant hyperthermia (MH) is a pharmacogenetic disorder of skeletal muscle that presents as a hypermetabolic response to potent volatile anesthetic gases such as halothane, sevoflurane, desflurane and the depolarizing muscle relaxant succinylcholine, and rarely in humans, to stresses such as vigorous exercise and heat. The classic signs of MH include marked hyperthermia, tachycardia, tachypnea, increased carbon dioxide production, increased oxygen consumption, acidosis, muscle rigidity and rhabdomyolysis, all of which are related to a hypermetabolic response. In humans, the syndrome is inherited in autosomal dominant pattern.|Hypokalemic periodic paralysis (hypoPP) is characterised by episodes of muscle paralysis lasting from a few to 24-48 hours and associated with a fall in blood potassium levels. Prevalence is estimated at around 1 in 100,000. The paralysis most often affects the four limbs, thus resulting in tetraplegia.

A cation-specific, but otherwise relatively non-selective, ion channel with low conductance. Ca2+-permeability is related to subunit composition with 5HT3A homopentamers being more permeable than 5HT3A/B heteropentamers. Found pre- and post-synaptically but with different properties - pre-synaptic 5-HT3 receptors are predominantly calcium-permeant while post-synaptic receptors are permeant to Na+ and K+. Also Mg2+ permeant. Pre-synaptic depolarisations are generally slower than post-synaptic depolarisations. 5-HT3 receptors increase the frequency of spontaneous excitatory post-synaptic currents (sEPSCs) or miniature EPSCs (mEPSCs). These may be related to 5-HT3-induced depolarisation of pre-synaptic membranes and subsequent activation of cholinergic or glutamatergic neurotransmissions or evoked excitatory post-synaptic currents (eEPSCs) or spontaneous inhibitory post-synaptic currents (sIPSCs) related to GABAergic neurotransmissions post-synaptic 5-HT3 receptor activation. Due to different residues in transmembrane domain M2 of the 5-HT3A and 5-HT3B subunits the 5-HT3A/B heteromeric receptors are more efficient conductors than 5-HT3A homomeric receptors and have increased agonist and antagonist affinity. Homomeric receptors recover faster from desensitisation but are probably less prevalent in vivo. High levels of expression are found in the vagal terminals of the dorsal vagal complex where it is involved in the vomiting reflex (especially post-operative and chemotherapy- and radiation-induced vomiting and nausea), in the amygdala and the hippocampi. 5-HT3 receptor antagonists therefore act as effective anti-emetic drugs. Lower levels of expression are found in the forebrain with higher relative expression in the striatum than the cortical regions. Involved in processes associated with emotion, cognition, memory and pain perception. Involved in ganglionic transmission in the myenteric plexus in the mucosal layer and expressed in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract where serotonin mediates control over a variety of physiological functions such as the contraction/relaxation of smooth muscle, and peristaltic and secretory reflexes, directly or indirectly through intrinsic primary afferent neurons. Plays an important role in the regulation of inflammation and immune responses in the peripheral nervous system. Activation of 5-HT3 receptors on visceral afferents in some irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients results in visceral hypersensitivity. Chaperone proteins assist assembly, modifications and export from the ER followed by transport in vesicle-like structures along microtubules to the plasma membrane where they typically form clusters in F-actin-rich regions.	Pentamer that forms a central channel. Each subunit consists of a large, N-terminal, extracellular domain, four transmembrane (TM) domains (M1-M4), of which M2 lines the channel, as well as intra- and extracellular loops connecting the TM domains and an extracellular C-terminus. Cation selectivity is determined by the M2 TM domain as well as the cytoplasmic M3-M4 loop while conductance efficiency is related to residues in the M3-M4 loop. The 5-HT3A subunits, at least, are N-glycosylated and phosphorylated in the cytoplasmic M3-M4 loop. The 5-HT3A subunit exists as different splice variants in different mammalian species, some of which are only functional in complex with canonical chains. In the 5-HT3A/B heteromer, the 5-HT3A shields the ER-retention signal of the 5-HT3B subunit allowing export of the heteromeric complex from the ER to the plasma membrane.	-	serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, CHEBI:28790)	Schizophrenia [EFO:0000692]: A severe emotional disorder of psychotic depth characteristically marked by a retreat from reality with delusion formation, HALLUCINATIONS, emotional disharmony, and regressive behaviour.|Depression [EFO:0003761]: Severe mental disorder with onset in MIDDLE AGE, marked by withdrawl, abnormal affect, disturbed intellectual processes, and there may be regression.|Bipolar disorder [EFO:0000289]: A major affective disorder marked by severe mood swings (manic or major depressive episodes) and a tendency to remission and recurrence.|Post-operative nausea and vomiting [EFO:0004888]: Emesis and queasiness occurring after anesthesia.|Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting [EFO:0006911]: Emesis and queasiness occurring after chemotherapy.|Radiation-induced nausea and vomiting [EFO:0006912]: Emesis and queasiness occurring after radiotherapy.	-	-	-	psi-mi:"MI:0469"(IntAct)

Ligand binding causes a conformational change of the receptor resulting in the formation of a pore that is permeable to Na+ and/or Ca2+ (inward) and K+ (outward) thereby depolarising the neuron. Mediates fast, short-lived, mainly pre-synaptic transmission of neurotransmitters. Major receptor in Central Nervous System and predominantly found in cerebellum, cortex, forebrain, hippocampus, mesencephalon, striatum, superior colliculus and thalamus. Up-regulated by pro-inflammatory cytokines, for example TNF-alpha.	The alpha4-beta2 complex is found with stoichiometry of 2:3 and 3:2 (CPX-168); the 2:3-type is the receptor that is most sensitive to nicotine exposure and desensitisation. Upon chronic exposure it takes over from the 3:2-type. The 3:2-type is the acetylcholine receptor most permeable to Ca2+. The alpha subunit always supplies the ‘plus’-side of the ligand binding interface and determines ligand affinity whilst any subunit can supply the ‘minus’-binding side which determines ligand selectivity. At least two ligand binding sides are present. Each subunit has four transmembrane domains and the transmembrane domains line the channel, influencing channel conductance and ion selectivity.

Activated under low extracellular sodium concentrations and self-inhibited by high extracellular sodium concentrations. Activation is dependent on proteolytic cleavage of alpha and gamma subunits, post-translational modifications (such as glycosylation of beta subunit and palmitoylation) and possibly cyclic nucleotides that lift self-inhibition. Regulated by hormones such as aldosterone and vasopressin and inhibited by the diuretic amiloride. Although the channel activity itself is not voltage-gated, ameloride-sensitivity may be voltage-dependent. Channel gating and conductance are comparatively slow. Plays an essential role in electrolyte and blood pressure homeostasis, but also in airway surface liquid (ASL) homeostasis, which is important for proper clearance of mucus and pathogens. Mutations leading to a loss of ASL homeostatis are a trigger for cystic fibrosis. The inward sodium transport may trigger action potentials in neurons by gradually depolarizing membrane potentials. In nephrons may also be activated by shear stress potentially changing the conformation of the bulky extracellular loop or the transmembrane domains and thereby increasing channel opening times. May also play a role in salt and sour taste perception. Found in the apical membrane of many epithelial cell types, especially in the Aldosterone Sensitive Distal Nephron (ASDN), kidney, colon, lung and sweat glands but also in heart, liver, pancreas, skeletal muscle and blood leukocytes. Also expressed in vascular endothelia where their mechanical properties and function differ from epithelial sodium channels (ENaCs) in other tissues: vascular endothelia are ‘leaky’, allowing passive sodium transport through the membrane. Here, ENaCs are activated by increased external sodium concentrations that enhances the sodium influx into the cell. May stabilize F-actin through strengthening of the inter-subunits causing swelling or stiffening of endothelia and which can ultimately lead to hypertension. 	The stoichiometry is uncertain and could be heterotrimeric, heterohexameric, heterononameric with equal ratios for the three subunits or heterotetrameric with alpha-beta-gamma ratio of 2:1:1. The beta and gamma subunits regulate the channel activity and the alpha subunit regulates channel conductance. Transmembrane domain (TM) 1 lines the plasma membrane, TM2 lines the channel. 	-	-	Pseudohypoaldosteronism type I (PHA1) [Orphanet:756]: a primary form of mineralocorticoid resistance presenting in the newborn with renal salt wasting, failure to thrive and dehydration.

Caused by truncations of or mutation in PY motif of beta or gamma subunits leading to constitutive activation of the renal epithelial sodium channel. The PY motif contains the E3 ligase interaction site that is essential for the ubiquination and degradation of subunits. Constitutive activation of the epithelial sodium channel can also be caused by high dietary salt intake or excessive licorice consumption.|Hypertension [EFO:0000537]: persistently high systemic arterial blood pressure. Based on multiple readings, hypertension is currently defined as when systolic pressure is consistently greater than 140 mm Hg or when diastolic pressure is consistently 90 mm Hg or more. Loss of epithelial sodium channel self-inhibition activity under high sodium conditions leads to salt-sensitive hypertension [MP:0004217]: sustained high blood pressure that is maintained with the amount of salt consumed in the diet; blood pressure may return to normotensive with a low salt diet.|Cystic fibrosis (CF) [Orphanet:586]: an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by the production of sweat with a high salt content and mucus secretions with an abnormal viscosity due to airway surface liquid (ASL) dehydration. As the mucus traps particles and pathogens a lack of regular mucus clearance in patients can lead to serious lung infections. The disease is chronic and generally progressive, with onset usually occurring during early childhood or, occasionally, at birth (meconium ileus). Virtually any internal organ may be involved but the principle manifestations concern the breathing apparatus (chronic bronchitis), pancreas (pancreatic insufficiency, adolescent diabetes and occasionally pancreatitis) and, more rarely, the intestine (stercoral obstruction) or liver (cirrhosis). The most common form of cystic fibrosis is associated with respiratory symptoms, digestive problems (steatorrhea and/or constipation), elevated sweat electrolytes and staturoponderal growth anomalies. Mortality and morbidity depend on the extent of bronchopulmonary involvement. Male sterility is a constant feature. Late-onset forms, which are usually only mild or monosymptomatic, have also been reported. Characterized by alterations in the CFTR protein (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, P13569). The absence of the CFTR in apical membranes causes epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) hyperactivity, excessive sodium absorption, ASL dehydration and acidification of the extracellular space leading to lung infections. SPLUNC1 negatively regulates ENaC activity and therefore maintains normal ASL homeostasis. Under ASL dehydration and acidic conditions this interaction is abolished.|Bronchiectasis [HP:0002110]: a bronchial disease that is a chronic inflammatory condition of one or more bronchi or bronchioles marked by dilatation and loss of elasticity of the walls resulting from damage to the airway wall leading to the formation of small sacs on the bronchial wall and impairment of cilia mobility in the lung. Inflammation of the bronchial wall increases mucus secretion which serves as a breeding ground for bacteria. Bronchiectasis is caused by repeated respiratory infections, immune deficiency disorders, hereditary disorders (cystic fibrosis or primary ciliary dyskinesia), mechanical factors (inhaled object or a lung tumor) or inhaling toxic substances.	-	amiloride (CHEBI:2639)|zinc ion (Zn2+, CHEBI:29105)	-	psi-mi:"MI:0469"(IntAct)

Activated by simultaneous binding of glycine to GluN1 and L-glutamate to GluN2. Blocked by physiological concentrations of extracellular magnesium which is released by membrane depolarization. Predominantly post-synaptic receptor that mediates mostly the late/slow phase of the majority of the fast excitatory neurotransmission in the mammalian brain where it plays a key role in synaptic plasticity, synaptogenesis, excitotoxicity, memory acquisition and learning. Combinations of different receptor isoforms and their splice variants result in formation of ion channels with distinct spatiotemporal expression patterns and pharmacological and electrophysiological properties. Replacement of one or more subunits with GluN3A (Q8TCU5) or GluN3B (O60391) subunits results in relatively Ca2+-impermeable cation channels that are resistant to Mg2+. Dysfunctional NMDA receptors are implicated in various neurological disorders and injuries including depression, schizophrenia, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, chronic and neuropathic pain, as well as neuronal loss following ischaemia or stroke.	Obligate heterotetramer formed around a central pore, with distinct domains that are arranged in parallel for all subunits. Topology of the N1/N2 units probably of 1-2-1-2 arrangement but some experiments suggest 1-1-2-2 arrangement. The GluN1 subunits occupy a proximal position, closer to the central axis of the channel pore than that of GluN2/N3 subunits. GluN1 and GluN3 bind allosteric activators glycine or D-serine and GluN2 binds allosteric activators L-glutamate or NMDA at the extracellular ligand-binding domain formed by the N1-N2/N3 heterodimers. NMDA mimicks the action of glutamate, specifically binds to GluN2 subunits and regulates the NMDA-type iGlu receptors only. Polyamines act as allosteric modulators by binding to the extracellular n-terminal domain (NTD). Zn2+ acts as an allosteric inhibitor by binding to the bilobed cleft of the NTD. H+ also acts as an allosteric inhibitor but its binding site remains uncertain. Mg2+ binds the "GluN2 S/L site" of the transmembrane domain.

In some cases the proteolytic action activates the substrate, for example, it cleaves CDK5R1/p35 (Q15078) into its p25 form that is associated with Alzheimer's disease. Involved in cytoskeletal remodeling, signal transduction and implicated in cell cycle regulation and apoptosis. Finely-balanced calpain homeostasis is required as both over and under-activation causes disease. Calpain complexes recognise their substrates based on a short peptide sequence. Inhibited by the intrinsically-unstructured calpastatin (P20810) by its tight binding to the calpain catalytic subunit. 	Calpain (CAPN2/mCL) and its small regulatory subunit (CAPNS1/30K) bind via their respective 5th (of 5) EF-hand motifs. The N-terminus of CAPNS1 contains hydrophobic Gly-clusters, the Gly-rich domain. The catalytically-active cleft is rather deep and narrow which might explains calpain's preference for digesting inter-domain unstructured regions. It is formed by the two calpain protease core domains, PC1 and PC2, containing one Ca2+-binding sites per core. Calcium binding to several domains of both subunits releases the steric hindrance by allowing PC1 and PC2 to move closer to each other while the secondary structures remain essentially unchanged and may result in the dissociation of the small regulatory subunit from the catalytic subunits. Most other members of the calpain family of proteins do not require a regulatory subunit and are activated directly by calcium binding. 	-	Calcium ion (Ca2+, CHEBI:29108)	Autosomal recessive spastic paraplegia type 76 [EFO:0009019]: Spastic paraplegia-76 is an autosomal recessive neurologic disorder characterized by young-adult onset of slowly progressive spasticity of the lower limbs resulting in gait difficulties.

The disease can be classified into clinical subtypes of increasing severity: silent alpha thalassemia, alpha thalassemia trait (or alpha thalassemia minor), hemoglobin H disease (HbH, [Orphanet:93616]), and Hb Bart's hydrops fetalis [Orphanet:163596]. A rare form called alpha-thalassemia-intellectual deficit syndrome linked to chromosome 16 (16p13.3) has also been identified. Alpha thalassemia trait causes microcytosis and hypochromia with absent or mild anemia (often detected on routine blood tests), generally with no other symptoms. HbH patients develop moderate hemolytic anemia with variable amounts of HbH along with occasionally severe splenomegaly, sometimes complicated by hypersplenism. Hb Bart's hydrops fetalis involves a severe deficiency in alpha-globin with serious developmental implications. Alpha-thalassemia-intellectual deficit syndrome is characterized by very mild to severe anemia associated with developmental abnormalities.|Hemoglobinopathy Toms River [Orphanet:280615]: a form of neonatal cyanosis, characterized by symptoms in the fetus and neonate. Caused by a defect in the fetal hemoglobin chain, which causes reduced affinity for oxygen due to steric inhibition of oxygen binding and/or due to increased oxidation of the fetal hemoglobin molecule to methemoglobin (Hb FM). Some patients develop anemia resulting from increased destruction of red cells containing abnormal or unstable hemoglobin. Resolves spontaneously by 5 to 6 months of age or earlier, as the adult beta-globin (HBB) chain is produced and replaces the fetal gamma-globin chain.	-	-	-	psi-mi:"MI:0469"(IntAct)

The Kir2.1 channel is characterized by a strong inward rectification, in which K+ ions flow preferentially into rather than out of the cell. Their voltage dependence is regulated by the concentration of extracellular potassium; as external potassium is raised, the voltage range of the channel opening shifts to more positive voltages. Inward rectification is produced by cytosolic polyamines and Mg2+ occluding the ion conductance pathway as K+ ions are flowing outward. These positively charged particles are then removed from the pore when K+ ions flow into the cell. Rectification is the primary means of gating for Kir2 channels. In addition to rectification, another common feature of Kir channels is regulation by the membrane phospholipid PIP2. Opening of Kir channels requires PIP2 binding to basic and polar amino acids in the cytoplasmic domains, whereas depletion of PIP2 seems to close the channel. Expressed in brain, heart and skeletal muscle.	In addition to the homotetramer, KCNJ2 can form heterotetramers with other members of the Kir2 protein family.

This extremely rare syndrome affects mainly young adults or infants. The clinical spectrum is very wide ranging from asymptomatic carriers to syncope or sudden death. It is frequently associated with atrial fibrillation. Mutations in three different genes KCNQ1, KCNH2, and KCNJ2, all encoding cardiac ionic potassium channels have been identified in affected patients. Transmission is autosomal dominant. Expression studies have shown a gain of function and a shortening of the action potential duration, explaining the short QT interval.	-	-	-	psi-mi:"MI:0469"(IntAct)

Often, but not always, phosphorylates the transcription factor using beta-d-fructofuranose 1,6-bisphosphate (CHEBI:28013) as phosphate donor. Nuclear translocation is induced by PIAS3-mediated sumoylation and ERK2-mediated phosphorylation on Ser-37. Redirects glucose-derived carbons towards biosynthesis, indirectly supporting the Warburg effect, by regulating gene expression in the nucleus. This switch is tightly controlled by oncogenes, tumor suppressors and growth signals and affected by post-translational modifications of PKM2. Important allosteric affectors for the dimeric state are human papilloma virus E7, promyelocytic leukemia (PML, P29590), EGFR-mediated-pY46-MUC1-C (P15941), phosphor-tyrosine proteins and SAICAR (succinyl-5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-ribose-50-phosphate).

In response to TGF-beta/activin-family protein binding, TGF-beta type II receptors phosphorylate TGF-beta type I receptors (ALK4, 5 and 7) which in turn phosphorylates SMAD3 on two Ser-423 and Ser-425. This enables binding to SMAD4 to form heteromeric SMAD complexes that enter the nucleus to initiate gene transcription. Because of their relatively low DNA-binding affinity, SMAD complexes interact with a wide variety of DNA-binding proteins. Crosstalk with other signalling pathways and interaction with other DNA-binding cofactors define the specific binding patterns of SMADs; in addition, interaction with coactivators/corepressors modulates their transcriptional activity.	Preferential formation of the regulatory R-Smad/SMAD4 heterotrimer over the R-Smad homotrimer is largely enthalpy driven, contributed by the unique presence of strong electrostatic interactions within the heterotrimeric interfaces. These electrostatic interactions exist only in the heterotrimer due to specific charged residues in the SMAD4 subunit, Asp-493 and Arg-378, mediating complementary electrostatic interactions with the neighboring R-Smad subunits.

High Ca+2 concentration inhibits RyR3, by binding to less specific low-affinity Ca+2 sites. ATP stimulates RyR1 channel activity. Calmodulin with bound calcium inhibits the RyR3 channel activity, as is binding to magnesium ions (Mg+2). Binding to FKBP may physically stabilize the coordinated gating of the four RyRs in one RyR homotetramer.

In the unphosphorylated form PLN inhibits the sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA), a membrane protein responsible for the pumping most of the calcium from the cytoplasm to the SR, thereby causing a relaxation of myofibrils.	The cardiac PLN homopentamer is a 30-kDa complex composed of 5 PLN monomers.

When the muscle cell is stimulated to contract by an action potential, calcium channels open in the sarcoplasmic membrane and release calcium into the sarcoplasm. Some of this calcium binds to specific sites in the N-domain of TnC, triggering a series of protein structural changes and tropomyosin is rolled away from myosin-binding sites on actin, allowing myosin to attach to the thin filament and produce force and/or shorten the sarcomere of the cardiomyocyte.

Target proteins are recognised by the CDC37 subunit. HSP90 does not bind any particular motif but rather associates with intrinsically unstable kinases. Complex binding also prevents rapid ubiquitin-dependent proteosomal degradation of target proteins.	CDC37 binds its target proteins via its N-terminus (1-120 aa, InterPro IPR013855) and the HSP90 subunit via its central domain. Binding of CDC37 to HSP90 blocks the ATP binding site on HSP90.

The complex is asymmetric. The Mad1 chains interact via the N-terminal coiled-coil involving the N-terminal helix. Mad1 residues 527-539 are involved in a number of additional interactions with Mad2.

The extensive interactions between the two proteins indicate that Telethonin provides a 'bridge' that anchors the ends of two different Titin molecules to the Z disk. There is evidence that Telethonin binding to Titin might be essential for the initial assembly, stabilization and functional integrity of the Titin filament and hence important for muscle contraction relaxation in mature myofibrils.	The N-terminus of Titin comprising of Z1 and Z2 IgG-like domains is assembled into an antiparallel sandwich complex with the titin-binding domain of telethonin with a 2:1 stoichiometry. Telethonin has a pseudosymmetric structure which mediates a palindromic arrangement of two Titin filaments. This arrangement is unique, previously found only in palindromic or pseudopalindromic protein-DNA complexes. Structural and binding evidence suggests that telethonin might act as a Titin-Titin crosslinker, indicating the binding is very tight. It is believed that the Titin N-terminus-Telethonin complex forms a core that interacts with several ligands both inside and outside the sarcomeric Z disk, including MLP, sAnkyrin, the beta subunit of the minK potassium channel , gamma-filamin/ABP-L, alpha actinin and the telethonin binding protein of the Z disk (FATZ).

Na+/K+ pumps can also generate an inward current of protons. Each transport cycle comprises a sequence of conformational transitions that permit extracellular K+ ions to access the binding sites in phosphorylated pumps and cytoplasmic Na+ ions to access the sites after dephosphorylation . Binding of the third Na+ ion triggers autophosphorylation, and binding of the second K+ ion prompts auto-dephosphorylation. This coupling of alternating ion access to ATP hydrolysis ensures forward, energetically uphill, progress of the Na+/K+ transport cycle. The larger pumped Na+ efflux than K+ influx constitutes outward current, a direction tending to make the membrane potential more negative. However, because each step in the cycle is reversible , if the normally transported intracellular Na+ and extracellular K+ are both scarce, the cycle can run backward, thus synthesizing ATP and generating inward, depolarizing current. 	The alpha subunit contains the Na+, K+ and ATP binding sites. The beta subunit is required for routing of the alpha subunit to the plasma membrane and for occlusion of the K+ ions. The gamma subunit regulates the pumping activity in a tissue- and isoform-specific way. Occlusion of K+ is vital for the stability of the complex.

Activated by binding of MgADP or MgATP to the nucleotide binding domains (NBD) of the ABCC9/SUR2A subunit as well as extracellular K+ binding to the KCNJ11/Kir6.2 subunit. If MgATP binds it must first get hydrolised by the ATP hydrolysis activity of the NBD which also generates PtdIns(4,5)P2 from phosphatidylinositol. Channel activation possibly driven by conformational changes resulting from MgADP binding to SUR subunits and reducing ATP affinity to Kir6.2. Inhibited by intracellular ATP or ADP, Mg2+ and polyamines that bind to the Kir6.2 subunits. ATP/ADP probably changes the conformation of Kir6.2 while Mg2+ and polyamines physically block the flow of K+ through the channel pore. Also inhibited by exogenous sulfonylureas by binding to intracellular loops (possibly by displacing MgADP from NBDs). As ATP is a weak inhibitor Kir6.2 channels can open spontaneously and are classified as constitutively active ion channels. In the absence of ATP (but presence of MgATP), cardiac channels exhibit spontaneous bursts of rapid openings and closings (fast kinetics), which are separated by long closed intervals (slow kinetics). Conversely, ATP destabilizes channel open state and stabilizes its closed states by increasing the speed of gating. Found predominantly in cardiac smooth muscle, skeletal muscle smooth muscle, neurons and ovaries. Gating of the atrial K+ channel is mechanosensitive, and mechanical pressure applied to a cardiac cell leads to an increase in their activity.	The four Kir6.2/KCNJ11 subunits form the K+ channel with the ABCC9/SUR2A subunits attached round the outside of the channel by interaction of their respective N- and C-terminal cytoplasmic loops. These form a beta sheet that acts as a gating regulator. There are three different SUR subunits, SUR1 (ABCC8), SUR2A and SUR2B (ABCC9 isoforms 1 and 2). SUR1 channels are ~4-fold more ATP-sensitive than SUR2 channels.

Required for the elongation of isolation membranes (phagophores). Acts as an E3-like enzyme to recruit the E2-like protein ATG3, conjugated to LC3-I, to the endoplasmic reticulum-derived omegasome. ATG3 binds to and is activated by ATG12, facilitating conjugation of the LC3 to phosphatidylethanolamine, thus converting LC3-I to LC3-II. Therefore, the site of ATG12–ATG5-ATG16L1 complex recruitment determines the site of LC3-II formation. The LC3 family is required for phagophore expansion, closure, and cargo recruitment.	ATG12 is constitutively conjugated to ATG5, via a glycyl-lysine isopeptide. Formation of the complex is mediated by ATG16L1 homo-oligomerization. Additionally ATG16L1 contains repeat WD40 domains, which facilitate the conjugation of LC3s to PE by recruiting other autophagic components onto the phagophore membrane and forming an approximately 800-kDa oligomeric complex, sedimentation studies suggest a 1:1 stoichiometry for ATG16L1 to ATG12-ATG5.

Topology of the N1/N2 units probably of 1-2-1-2 arrangement but some experiments suggest 1-1-2-2 arrangement. The GluN1 subunits occupy a proximal position, closer to the central axis of the channel pore than that of GluN2/N3 subunits. GluN1 and GluN3 bind allosteric activators glycine or D-serine and GluN2 binds allosteric activators L-glutamate or NMDA at the extracellular ligand-binding domain formed by the N1-N2/N3 heterodimers. NMDA mimicks the action of glutamate, specifically binds to GluN2 subunits and regulates the NMDA-type iGlu receptors only. Polyamines act as allosteric modulators by binding to the extracellular n-terminal domain (NTD). Zn2+ acts as an allosteric inhibitor by binding to the bilobed cleft of the NTD. H+ also acts as an allosteric inhibitor but its binding site remains uncertain. Mg2+ binds the "GluN2 S/L site" of the transmembrane domain.

A cation-specific, but otherwise relatively non-selective, ion channel with low conductance. Ca2+-permeability is related to subunit composition with 5HT3A homopentamers being more permeable than 5HT3A/B heteropentamers. Found pre- and post-synaptically but with different properties - pre-synaptic 5-HT3 receptors are predominantly calcium-permeant while post-synaptic receptors are permeant to Na+ and K+. Also Mg2+ permeant. Pre-synaptic depolarisations are generally slower than post-synaptic depolarisations. 5-HT3 receptors increase the frequency of spontaneous excitatory post-synaptic currents (sEPSCs) or miniature EPSCs (mEPSCs). These may be related to 5-HT3-induced depolarisation of pre-synaptic membranes and subsequent activation of cholinergic or glutamatergic neurotransmissions or evoked excitatory post-synaptic currents (eEPSCs) or spontaneous inhibitory post-synaptic currents (sIPSCs) related to GABAergic neurotransmissions post-synaptic 5-HT3 receptor activation. Due to different residues in transmembrane domain M2 of the 5-HT3A and 5-HT3B subunits the 5-HT3A/B heteromeric receptors are more efficient conductors than 5-HT3A homomeric receptors and have increased agonist and antagonist affinity. Homomeric receptors recover faster from desensitisation but are probably less prevalent in vivo. High levels of expression are found in the vagal terminals of the dorsal vagal complex where it is involved in the vomiting reflex (especially post-operative and chemotherapy- and radiation-induced vomiting and nausea), in the amygdala and the hippocampi. 5-HT3 receptor antagonists therefore act as effective anti-emetic drugs. Lower levels of expression are found in the forebrain with higher relative expression in the striatum than the cortical regions. Involved in processes associated with emotion, cognition, memory and pain perception. Involved in ganglionic transmission in the myenteric plexus in the mucosal layer and expressed in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract where serotonin mediates control over a variety of physiological functions such as the contraction/relaxation of smooth muscle, and peristaltic and secretory reflexes, directly or indirectly through intrinsic primary afferent neurons. Plays an important role in the regulation of inflammation and immune responses in the peripheral nervous system. Activation of 5-HT3 receptors on visceral afferents in some irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients results in visceral hypersensitivity. Chaperone proteins assist assembly, modifications and export from the ER followed by transport in vesicle-like structures along microtubules to the plasma membrane where they typically form clusters in F-actin-rich regions.	Pentamer that forms a central channel. Each subunit consists of a large, N-terminal, extracellular domain, four transmembrane (TM) domains (M1-M4), of which M2 lines the channel, as well as intra- and extracellular loops connecting the TM domains and an extracellular C-terminus. Cation selectivity is determined by the M2 TM domain as well as the cytoplasmic M3-M4 loop while conductance efficiency is related to residues in the M3-M4 loop. The 5-HT3A subunits, at least, are N-glycosylated and phosphorylated in the cytoplasmic M3-M4 loop. The 5-HT3A subunit exists as different splice variants in different mammalian species, some of which are only functional in complex with canonical chains. In the 5-HT3A/B heteromer, the 5-HT3A shields the ER-retention signal of the 5-HT3B subunit allowing export of the heteromeric complex from the ER to the plasma membrane.	-	serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, CHEBI:28790)	Schizophrenia [EFO:0000692]: A severe emotional disorder of psychotic depth characteristically marked by a retreat from reality with delusion formation, HALLUCINATIONS, emotional disharmony, and regressive behaviour.|Depression [EFO:0003761]: Severe mental disorder with onset in MIDDLE AGE, marked by withdrawl, abnormal affect, disturbed intellectual processes, and there may be regression.|Bipolar disorder [EFO:0000289]: A major affective disorder marked by severe mood swings (manic or major depressive episodes) and a tendency to remission and recurrence.|Post-operative nausea and vomiting [EFO:0004888]: Emesis and queasiness occurring after anesthesia.|Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting [EFO:0006911]: Emesis and queasiness occurring after chemotherapy.|Radiation-induced nausea and vomiting [EFO:0006912]: Emesis and queasiness occurring after radiotherapy.	-	-	-	psi-mi:"MI:0469"(IntAct)

Through its interaction with VWF immobilized at the damaged blood vessel wall, the GPIb-IX-V complex mediates the initial tethering and rolling of circulating platelets to the injury site. The rolling reduces platelet velocity and prolongs the contact time with components of the cell matrix, facilitating platelet activation and subsequent integrin-mediated firm attachment.

Modulated by intracellular chloride ions and pH; acidic pH shifts the activation to more negative voltages. Contrary to other ion-gated channels, HCN channels do not require an accessory unit but depolarisation activity is affected by optional accessory proteins such as TRIP8b (PEX5L, Q8IYB4) or lipids such as phosphatidylinositol-4,5-biphosphate.	Each HCN2 subunit contains a transmembrane domain (TMD), similar to other voltage-gated K+ channels, and a C-terminal cyclic nucleotide binding domain (CNBD).

Activated under low extracellular sodium concentrations and low extracellular pH and self-inhibited by high extracellular sodium concentrations. Activation is dependent on proteolytic cleavage of alpha and gamma subunits, post-translational modifications (such as glycosylation of beta subunit and palmitoylation) and possibly cyclic nucleotides that lift self-inhibition. Regulated by hormones such as aldosterone and vasopressin and inhibited by the diuretic amiloride. Although the channel activity itself is not voltage-gated, ameloride-sensitivity may be voltage-dependent. Channel gating and conductance are comparatively slow. Plays an essential role in electrolyte and blood pressure homeostasis, but also in airway surface liquid (ASL) homeostasis, which is important for proper clearance of mucus and pathogens. Mutations leading to a loss of ASL homeostatis are a trigger for cystic fibrosis. The inward sodium transport may trigger action potentials in neurons by gradually depolarizing membrane potentials. In nephrons may also be activated by shear stress potentially changing the conformation of the bulky extracellular loop or the transmembrane domains and thereby increasing channel opening times. May also play a role in salt and sour taste perception. Found in the apical membrane of many epithelial cell types, especially in the Aldosterone Sensitive Distal Nephron (ASDN), kidney, colon, lung and sweat glands but also in heart, liver, pancreas, skeletal muscle and blood leukocytes. Also expressed in vascular endothelia where their mechanical properties and function differ from epithelial sodium channels (ENaCs) in other tissues: vascular endothelia are ‘leaky’, allowing passive sodium transport through the membrane. Here, ENaCs are activated by increased external sodium concentrations that enhances the sodium influx into the cell. May stabilize F-actin through strengthening of the inter-subunits causing swelling or stiffening of endothelia and which can ultimately lead to hypertension.

Loss of epithelial sodium channel self-inhibition activity under high sodium conditions leads to salt-sensitive hypertension [MP:0004217]: sustained high blood pressure that is maintained with the amount of salt consumed in the diet; blood pressure may return to normotensive with a low salt diet.|Cystic fibrosis (CF) [Orphanet:586]: an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by the production of sweat with a high salt content and mucus secretions with an abnormal viscosity due to airway surface liquid (ASL) dehydration. As the mucus traps particles and pathogens a lack of regular mucus clearance in patients can lead to serious lung infections. The disease is chronic and generally progressive, with onset usually occurring during early childhood or, occasionally, at birth (meconium ileus). Virtually any internal organ may be involved but the principle manifestations concern the breathing apparatus (chronic bronchitis), pancreas (pancreatic insufficiency, adolescent diabetes and occasionally pancreatitis) and, more rarely, the intestine (stercoral obstruction) or liver (cirrhosis). The most common form of cystic fibrosis is associated with respiratory symptoms, digestive problems (steatorrhea and/or constipation), elevated sweat electrolytes and staturoponderal growth anomalies. Mortality and morbidity depend on the extent of bronchopulmonary involvement. Male sterility is a constant feature. Late-onset forms, which are usually only mild or monosymptomatic, have also been reported. Characterized by alterations in the CFTR protein (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, P13569). The absence of the CFTR in apical membranes causes epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) hyperactivity, excessive sodium absorption, ASL dehydration and acidification of the extracellular space leading to lung infections. SPLUNC1 negatively regulates ENaC activity and therefore maintains normal ASL homeostasis. Under ASL dehydration and acidic conditions this interaction is abolished.|Bronchiectasis [HP:0002110]: a bronchial disease that is a chronic inflammatory condition of one or more bronchi or bronchioles marked by dilatation and loss of elasticity of the walls resulting from damage to the airway wall leading to the formation of small sacs on the bronchial wall and impairment of cilia mobility in the lung. Inflammation of the bronchial wall increases mucus secretion which serves as a breeding ground for bacteria. Bronchiectasis is caused by repeated respiratory infections, immune deficiency disorders, hereditary disorders (cystic fibrosis or primary ciliary dyskinesia), mechanical factors (inhaled object or a lung tumor) or inhaling toxic substances.	-	amiloride (CHEBI:2639)|zinc ion (Zn2+, CHEBI:29105)	-	psi-mi:"MI:0469"(IntAct)

Contrary to classic nicotinic acetylcholine receptors nicotine blocks acetylcholine-evoked currents in alpha9 receptors giving these receptors a pharmacological profile unknown for any other nicotinic or muscarinic cholinergic receptor subtype. Ligand binding causes a conformational change of the receptor resulting in the formation of a pore that is permeable to Na+ and/or Ca2+ (inward) and K+ (outward) thereby depolarising the neuron. Upregulated by pro-inflammatory cytokines, like TNF-alpha. Mediates fast, short-lived synaptic transmission of neurotransmitters and is less active than the alpha9-alpha10 heteropentamer (CPX-2171). Mainly found in peripheral nervous system and non-neuronal cells, esp. in the auditory system (mechanosensory hair, inner-ear tissue, the cochlea) but also in tonsils, immortalized B-cells, cultured T-cells and PBMCs, keratinocytes and in the pituitary gland. In the auditory system assembles, possibly with the alpha10 subunit, to form the receptor that mediates synaptic transmission between efferent olivocochlear cholinergic fibers which descend from the brainstem and hair cells of the cochlea.	Homopentamer. The alpha subunit always supplies the ‘plus’-side of the ligand binding interface and determines ligand affinity whilst any subunit can supply the ‘minus’-binding side which determines ligand selectivity.

Activated by binding of MgADP or MgATP to the nucleotide binding domains (NBD) of the ABCC8/SUR1 subunit as well as extracellular K+ binding to the KCNJ11/Kir6.2 subunit. If MgATP binds it must first get hydrolised by the ATP hydrolysis activity of the NBD which also generates PtdIns(4,5)P2 from phosphatidylinositol. Channel activation possibly driven by conformational changes resulting from MgADP binding to SUR subunits and reducing ATP affinity to Kir6.2. Inhibited by intracellular ATP or ADP, Mg2+ and polyamines that bind to the Kir6.2 subunits. ATP/ADP probably changes the conformation of Kir6.2 while Mg2+ and polyamines physically block the flow of K+ through the channel pore. Also inhibited by exogenous sulfonylureas by binding to intracellular loops (possibly by displacing MgADP from NBDs) and used to treat diabetic disorders. As ATP is a weak inhibitor Kir6.2 channels can open spontaneously and are classified as constitutively active ion channels. In the absence of ATP (but presence of MgATP), cardiac and pancreatic channels exhibit spontaneous bursts of rapid openings and closings (fast kinetics), which are separated by long closed intervals (slow kinetics). Conversely, ATP destabilizes channel open state and stabilizes its closed states by increasing the speed of gating. Found predominantly in pancreatic beta-cells where glucose metabolism leads to an increase in intracellular ATP and a concomitant fall in MgADP causing closure of K+ channels, membrane depolarization and opening of voltage-gated calcium channels which ultimately triggers insulin release.	The four Kir6.2/KCNJ11 subunits form the K+ channel with the ABCC8/SUR1 subunits attached round the outside of the channel by interaction of their respective N- and C-terminal cytoplasmic loops. These form a beta sheet that acts as a gating regulator. There are three different SUR subunits, SUR1 (ABCC8), SUR2A and SUR2B (ABCC9 isoforms 1 and 2). SUR1 channels are approximately 4-fold more ATP-sensitive than SUR2 channels.

The pancreatic dysfunction may be maintained throughout life, with relapse initiated at times of metabolic stress such as puberty or pregnancy. In PNDM, insulin secretory failure occurs in the late fetal or early post-natal period, does not go into remission and requires continuous insulin treatment.

CSNK1A1 phosphorylates CTNNB1 on Ser-45 and primes successive phosphorylation of Thr-41, Ser-37, and Ser-33 by GSK3. Phosphorylation of CTNNB1 promotes its subsequent ubiquitination which targets the protein for degradation by the proteasome. Without Wnt, Axin is also phosphorylated by GSK3, and thereby kept in an active (‘open’) conformation for beta-catenin binding and degradation. Upon Wnt stimulation, the ternary WNT-FZ-LRP6 complex is formed and recruits the scaffold protein DVL and the beta-catenin destruction complex.

A cation-specific, but otherwise relatively non-selective, ion channel with low conductance. Ca2+-permeability is related to subunit composition with 5HT3A homopentamers being more permeable than 5HT3A/B heteropentamers. Found pre- and post-synaptically but with different properties - pre-synaptic 5-HT3 receptors are predominantly calcium-permeant while post-synaptic receptors are permeant to Na+ and K+. Also Mg2+ permeant. Pre-synaptic depolarisations are generally slower than post-synaptic depolarisations. 5-HT3 receptors increase the frequency of spontaneous excitatory post-synaptic currents (sEPSCs) or miniature EPSCs (mEPSCs). These may be related to 5-HT3-induced depolarisation of pre-synaptic membranes and subsequent activation of cholinergic or glutamatergic neurotransmissions or evoked excitatory post-synaptic currents (eEPSCs) or spontaneous inhibitory post-synaptic currents (sIPSCs) related to GABAergic neurotransmissions post-synaptic 5-HT3 receptor activation. High levels of expression are found in the vagal terminals of the dorsal vagal complex where it is involved in the vomiting reflex (especially post-operative and chemotherapy- and radiation-induced vomiting and nausea), in the amygdala and the hippocampi. 5-HT3 receptor antagonists therefore act as effective anti-emetic drugs. Lower levels of expression are found in the forebrain with higher relative expression in the striatum than the cortical regions. Involved in processes associated with emotion, cognition, memory and pain perception. Involved in ganglionic transmission in the myenteric plexus in the mucosal layer and expressed in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract serotonin mediates control over a variety of physiological functions such as the contraction/relaxation of smooth muscle, and peristaltic and secretory reflexes, directly or indirectly through intrinsic primary afferent neurons. Plays an important role in the regulation of inflammation and immune responses in the peripheral nervous system. Activation of 5-HT3 receptors on visceral afferents in some irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients results in visceral hypersensitivity. Chaperone proteins assist assembly, modifications and export from the ER followed by transport in vesicle-like structures along microtubules to the plasma membrane where they typically form clusters in F-actin-rich regions.	Pentamer that forms a central channel. Each subunit consists of a large, N-terminal, extracellular domain, four transmembrane (TM) domains (M1-M4), of which M2 lines the channel, as well as intra- and extracellular loops connecting the TM domains and an extracellular C-terminus. Cation selectivity is determined by the M2 TM domain as well as the cytoplasmic M3-M4 loop while conductance efficiency is related to residues in the M3-M4 loop. The 5-HT3A subunits, at least, are N-glycosylated and phosphorylated in the cytoplasmic M3-M4 loop. The 5-HT3A subunit exists as different splice variants in different mammalian species, some of which are only functional in complex with canonical chains.	-	Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, CHEBI:28790)	Schizophrenia [EFO:0000692]: A severe emotional disorder of psychotic depth characteristically marked by a retreat from reality with delusion formation, hallucinations, emotional disharmony, and regressive behaviour.|Depression [EFO:0003761]: Severe mental disorder with onset in MIDDLE AGE, marked by withdrawl, abnormal affect, disturbed intellectual processes, and there may be regression.|Bipolar disorder [EFO:0000289]: A major affective disorder marked by severe mood swings (manic or major depressive episodes) and a tendency to remission and recurrence.|Post-operative nausea and vomiting [EFO:0004888]: Emesis and queasiness occurring after anesthesia.|Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting [EFO:0006911]: Emesis and queasiness occurring after chemotherapy.|Radiation-induced nausea and vomiting [EFO:0006912]: Emesis and queasiness occurring after radiotherapy.	-	-	-	psi-mi:"MI:0469"(IntAct)

Catalytic subunit TERT and RNA template TERC (CPX-17) are essential for telomerase activity. Elongates the single-stranded G-rich 3-prime protruding ends of chromosomal DNA using TERC RNA as a template. TERC, Dyskerin, GAR1, NHP2 & NOP10 form the box H/ACA telomerase ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex which then binds to TERT forming the telomerase holoenzyme complex. WRAP53 (also known as TCAB1, Q9BUR4) binds to the CAB box in TERC and facilitates localization of the telomerase complex to Cajal bodies. In S-phase, telomerase holoenzyme complex is targeted from Cajal bodies to telomeres by binding of TERT to the shelterin subunit, ACD (Q96AP0). 	The interaction between the molecular chaperons p23 (PTGES3, Q15185) and HSP90 (HSP90AB1, P08238 or HSP90AA1, P07900) with the catalytic subunit TERT, following its synthesis in the cytoplasm, is essential to its function. TERC is cotranscribed with and is bound by dyskerin, NOP10, NHP2 and NAF1 (Q96HR8). Subsequently, NAF1 is substituted by GAR1. TERC, dyskerin, NOP10, NHP2 and GAR1 form a complex called the box H/ACA telomerase RNP (ribonucleoprotein) complex. The ATPases Reptin (RUVBL2, Q9Y230) and Pontin (RUVBL1, Q9Y265) bind to TERT and help to assemble the telomerase RNP complex and consequently the telomerase holoenzyme. WRAP53, TEP1 (Q99973), EST1A (SMG6, Q86US8) & POT1 (Q9NUX5) are probably closely associated with the complex but are not considered part of the complex itself. It is possible that the complex contains two copies of the enzyme telomerase, however, the nature of this in context of the other subunits is not clear yet.

It is involved in various processes related to chromatin dynamics: DNA replication, DNA damage and repair, transcription initiation and elongation. Binds histone H2A-H2B dimers and possibly small amounts of H3H4. Facilitates RNAPol II driven transcription through chromatin by destabilizing nucleosomal structure so that one of the H2A-H2B dimers is removed upon RNA Pol II passage. Subsequently brings back the histones and thereby maintains nucleosome integrity after RNA Pol II passage. Interacts with the active forms of the MCM complexes facilitating its unwinding activity. 	The acidic C-terminus of the SPT16 subunit (933-1047aa) is essential for the FACT-nucleosome interaction. SSRP1 residues 547-615 bind to DNA. Based on purification yields, it has been estimated that there are more than 100,000 molecules of FACT complex per cell.

A cation-specific, but otherwise relatively non-selective, ion channel with low conductance. Ca2+-permeability is related to subunit composition with 5HT3A homopentamers being more permeable than 5HT3A/B heteropentamers. Found pre- and post-synaptically but with different properties - pre-synaptic 5-HT3 receptors are predominantly calcium-permeant while post-synaptic receptors are permeant to Na+ and K+. Also Mg2+ permeant. Pre-synaptic depolarisations are generally slower than post-synaptic depolarisations. 5-HT3 receptors increase the frequency of spontaneous excitatory post-synaptic currents (sEPSCs) or miniature EPSCs (mEPSCs). These may be related to 5-HT3-induced depolarisation of pre-synaptic membranes and subsequent activation of cholinergic or glutamatergic neurotransmissions or evoked excitatory post-synaptic currents (eEPSCs) or spontaneous inhibitory post-synaptic currents (sIPSCs) related to GABAergic neurotransmissions post-synaptic 5-HT3 receptor activation. 5-HT3E subunits are exclusively expressed in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract where serotonin mediates control over a variety of physiological functions such as the contraction/relaxation of smooth muscle, and peristaltic and secretory reflexes, directly or indirectly through intrinsic primary afferent neurons. Plays an important role in the regulation of inflammation and immune responses in the peripheral nervous system. Activation of 5-HT3 receptors on visceral afferents in some irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients results in visceral hypersensitivity. Chaperone proteins assist assembly, modifications and export from the ER followed by transport in vesicle-like structures along microtubules to the plasma membrane where they typically form clusters in F-actin-rich regions.	Pentamer that forms a central channel. Each subunit consists of a large, N-terminal, extracellular domain, four transmembrane (TM) domains (M1-M4), of which M2 lines the channel, as well as intra- and extracellular loops connecting the TM domains and an extracellular C-terminus. Cation selectivity is determined by the M2 TM domain as well as the cytoplasmic M3-M4 loop while conductance efficiency is related to residues in the M3-M4 loop. The 5-HT3A subunits, at least, are N-glycosylated and phosphorylated in the cytoplasmic M3-M4 loop. The 5-HT3A subunit exists as different splice variants in different mammalian species, some of which are only functional in complex with canonical chains.	-	serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, CHEBI:28790)	Schizophrenia [EFO:0000692]: A severe emotional disorder of psychotic depth characteristically marked by a retreat from reality with delusion formation, HALLUCINATIONS, emotional disharmony, and regressive behaviour.|Depression [EFO:0003761]: Severe mental disorder with onset in MIDDLE AGE, marked by withdrawl, abnormal affect, disturbed intellectual processes, and there may be regression.|Bipolar disorder [EFO:0000289]: A major affective disorder marked by severe mood swings (manic or major depressive episodes) and a tendency to remission and recurrence.|Post-operative nausea and vomiting [EFO:0004888]: Emesis and queasiness occurring after anesthesia.|Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting [EFO:0006911]: Emesis and queasiness occurring after chemotherapy.|Radiation-induced nausea and vomiting [EFO:0006912]: Emesis and queasiness occurring after radiotherapy.	-	-	-	psi-mi:"MI:0469"(IntAct)

Activation is dependent on proteolytic cleavage of alpha and gamma subunits, post-translational modifications (such as glycosylation of beta subunit and palmitoylation) and possibly cyclic nucleotides that lift self-inhibition. Regulated by hormones such as aldosterone and vasopressin and inhibited by the diuretic amiloride. Although the channel activity itself is not voltage-gated, ameloride-sensitivity may be voltage-dependent. Channel gating and conductance are comparatively slow. Plays an essential role in electrolyte and blood pressure homeostasis, but also in airway surface liquid (ASL) homeostasis, which is important for proper clearance of mucus and pathogens. Mutations leading to a loss of ASL homeostatis are a trigger for cystic fibrosis. The inward sodium transport may trigger action potentials in neurons by gradually depolarizing membrane potentials. In nephrons may also be activated by shear stress potentially changing the conformation of the bulky extracellular loop or the transmembrane domains and thereby increasing channel opening times.

As the mucus traps particles and pathogens a lack of regular mucus clearance in patients can lead to serious lung infections. The disease is chronic and generally progressive, with onset usually occurring during early childhood or, occasionally, at birth (meconium ileus). Virtually any internal organ may be involved but the principle manifestations concern the breathing apparatus (chronic bronchitis), pancreas (pancreatic insufficiency, adolescent diabetes and occasionally pancreatitis) and, more rarely, the intestine (stercoral obstruction) or liver (cirrhosis). The most common form of cystic fibrosis is associated with respiratory symptoms, digestive problems (steatorrhea and/or constipation), elevated sweat electrolytes and staturoponderal growth anomalies. Mortality and morbidity depend on the extent of bronchopulmonary involvement. Male sterility is a constant feature. Late-onset forms, which are usually only mild or monosymptomatic, have also been reported. Characterized by alterations in the CFTR protein (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, P13569). The absence of the CFTR in apical membranes causes (epithelial sodium channel) ENaC hyperactivity, excessive sodium absorption, ASL dehydration and acidification of the extracellular space leading to lung infections. SPLUNC1 negatively regulates ENaC activity and therefore maintains normal ASL homeostasis. Under ASL dehydration and acidic conditions this interaction is abolished.|Bronchiectasis [HP:0002110]: a bronchial disease that is a chronic inflammatory condition of one or more bronchi or bronchioles marked by dilatation and loss of elasticity of the walls resulting from damage to the airway wall leading to the formation of small sacs on the bronchial wall and impairment of cilia mobility in the lung.

Once autophagosome formation is completed, the autophagosome docks lysosomes in order to degrade cellular cargoes by fusion. At this point, the surrounding acidic condition drives ATG5 to change its binding partner from ATG16L1 to TECPR1. Binding of the ATG12-ATG5 conjugate to a region of TECPR1 frees an auto-inhibition of the PH domain within this protein. This domain is then freed to attach to a phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate molecule of the autophagosomal membrane, thus tethering the autophagosome to a lysosome. These 2 vesicles will then undergo SNARE-mediated fusion to form an autolysosome.	ATG12 is constitutively conjugated to ATG5, via a glycyl-lysine isopeptide.	-	-	-	-	-	-	psi-mi:"MI:0469"(IntAct)

Membrane fission processes include: a) the sorting of multivesicular bodies (MVB) in the endocytic pathway; cargoes destined for inclusion into the MVB pathway are covalently modified with ubiquitin, recognized by ubiquitin-binding domains in the early ESCRTs (ESCRT-0, -I, and -II) and sequestered into endosomal microdomains that bud into the endosome as intralumenal vesicles aided by ESCRT-III, b) downregulation of cell-surface receptors, c) repair of plasma membrane wounds, d) abscission of the cellular bridge during cytokineses, d) nuclear envelope sealing by annular fusion and e) budding of virions (especially HIV-1) from the plasma membrane. The ESCRT machinery seems to play an indirect role in the proper functioning of cellular polarity and migration, the miRNA machinery and gene expression regulation. ESCRT-0 recruits ESCRT-I which engages ESCRT-II to nucleate ESCRT-III polymerization. VPS4A/B complex, also known as ESCRT-IV, disassembles ESCRT-III to recycle its subunits. The ESCRT-III complex facilitates changes in membrane architecture by oligomerizing to form spiral, filament-like tubules, accumulation of which is associated with membrane constriction and fission. Disassembly of ESCRT-III by VPS4A/B may be a required step for fission. CHMP1A, CHMP1B and CHMP5 are sometimes regarded as ESCRT-III accessory proteins rather than full complex members, suggesting that multiple variants with different core components and/or associated auxiliary factors may exist within the same cell and be active in different processes.	Monomers of ESCRT-III components take on a closed, self-inhibitory conformation. They are soluble owning to their N-terminal basic and C-terminal acidic regions that form tightly packed, helical hairpins. Structural studies suggest all ESCRT-III subunits are likely to adopt the 4-helix bundle configuration, with a fifth helix connected by a highly flexible linker. Subunits CHMP3 and CHMP6 facilitate anchorage of ESCRT-III to the membrane via the interaction of CHMP3 with phosphatidylinositol phosphate, releasing the conformational inhibition and allowing the complex to assemble into higher-order structures.	-	-	Neurodegenerative disease [EFO:0005772]: A disorder of the central nervous system characterized by gradual and progressive loss of neural tissue and neurological function.

Selectively cleaves the linkage between a glucuronic acid unit and an N-sulfo glucosamine unit of HSPGs carrying either a 3-O-sulfo, a 6-O-sulfo or a 2-O-sulfo group, but not linkages between a glucuronic acid unit and a 2-O-sulfated iduronic acid moiety. HS sulfation serves as a molecular signal that directs heparanase to cleave only certain glycan sites and acts as mechanistic handles by which the enzyme can prize open the substrate HS helix and more effectively access the trisaccharide cleavage site via heparanase-binding induced distortion of the substrate helix. Present in a variety of cellular locations where it performs an essential housekeeping role in catabolic processing of internalized HSPGs and at the cell surface or released into the ECM where it participates in ECM degradation and remodeling. HSPGs ensure that bioactive molecules such as growth factors, chemokines, lipoproteins, and enzymes are localized to the cell surface and ECM and function in the control of normal and pathological processes. These include morphogenesis, osteogenesis, hair follicle inner root sheath differentiation and hair homeostasis, wound healing, shedding of syndecans, inflammation, pre-eclampsia, autoimmunity, cell proliferation and migration associated with metastasis, endothelial invasion and angiogenesis. Cleavage of HSPGs is likely to release these regulators that can alter the functional state of tissues and provide a mechanism by which cells can respond rapidly to changes in the extracellular environment. The proliferative advantages conferred by heparanase lead to its up-regulation in tumors in a variety of tissues, and its over-expression correlates strongly with metastasis and worsened clinical prognoses. Also acts as pro-coagulant by increasing the generation of activation factor X in the presence of tissue factor and activation factor VII. Increases cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix (ECM) independent of its enzymatic activity. HPSE is the only mammalian gene so far identified to have heparanase activity. 	Secreted as a latent enzyme and internalized into late endosomes or lysosomes where it is subjected to proteolytic cleavage and activation. Cleavage at Glu109-Ser110 and Gln157-Lys158 yields an N-terminal 8 kDa and a C-terminal 50 kDa polypeptide that combine to form the catalytic site. Subsequent exocytosis transports the heparanase to its target sites. Prior to cleavage, the linker between the the 8 kD and 50 kD proteolytic chains acts as a steric block. Residues Glu-225 and Glu-343, located in the catalytic cleft, are crucial for its heparanase activity having been identified as the catalytic nucleophile and acid-base of HPSE.

Key modulator of macrophage cholesterol homeostasis and immune responses. Liver X receptors (LXR) function as lipid-activated transcription factors that mediate cholesterol, glucose and lipid metabolism and reverse cholesterol transport. The 9-cis retinoic acid receptor (retinoid X receptor, RXR) is an important member of the nuclear receptor family because it forms heterodimers with many other receptors, including the all-trans retinoic acid receptor (RAR). The effects of ligands on LXR, RXR, and other NRs are mediated through the ligand-binding domain (LBD). RXRA-LXRB is a permissive receptor that can be activated by the ligands of either partner. Upon ligand binding, the LBD undergoes a conformational change that results in the release of corepressors, the recruitment of coactivators, and the activation of transcription. 	All RXR heterodimers cooperatively bind response elements composed of two hexameric half-sites arranged in a direct repeat configuration with characteristic inter-half-site spacings of 1-5 base-pairs (known as DR1-DR5, respectively), giving the complex specificity for a 12-mer motif. DR motifs are asymmetric and can be read in one direction only. RXR-LXR complexes preferentially bind DR4. RXR and partner NR first dimerize, then bind to the DNA which involves polar functional groups in the minor grooves of DNA, as well as a well-ordered hydration spine associating with the DNA structure. A minor groove compression at the protein-protein junction is also electrostatically favorable. The LBDs share a common, mainly alpha-helical, fold that embeds a hydrophopic ligand-binding pocket. Ligands can affect the conformation of the ligand-dependent activation function 2 (AF-2) residing in the C-terminal alpha helix. An agonist allows this alpha helix to cover the ligand-binding pocket, thereby providing one of the sides in the coactivator-binding pocket. Conversely, an antagonist induces a conformation change blocking the coactivator-binding site and/or leading to recruitment of corepressors.

Plays a pivotal role during nervous system development and in various functions of mature central and peripheral nervous system. Regulates the NFAT signaling cascade by binding to and dephosphorylating NFAT leading to nuclear translocation of this larger complex and increasing the DNA-binding affinity of the NFAT family of transcription factors. Calcineurin also promotes nuclear retention of NFAT by masking nuclear export signals (NES) and preventing NES-dependent nuclear export.

Preferentially cleaves four-way DNA junctions, such as nicked Holliday Junctions (nHJs), D-loops, 3-prime flap DNA substrates that contain an exposed 5-prime DNA strand end at or close to the junction crossover point and replication forks, via the “nick and counternick” mechanism. DNA binding induces conformational changes in the linkers connecting the nuclease and HhH2 domains of MUS81 and EME1, which transforms the complex from a compact to an open state. These changes unmask the hydrophobic wedge that separates pre‐ and post‐nick duplex and create the 5-prime end binding pocket facilitating the DNA substrate bending by the complex, ultimately placing the incision strand at the active site of MUS81.

Restricted to processing linear and circular single-stranded RNAs only. RNAs with complex secondary structures, particularly at the 3-prime end of the molecule, may have to be unwound or pre-processed by co-factors prior to entering the complex. Although some RNAs may be targeted directly to the catalytic subunits, the majority of substrates enter the barrel-like structure of the exosome through a pore at the centre of the cap and are threaded through the central channel in a 3-prime to 5-prime orientation. The ribonuclease activity of the catalytic subunits facilitates the degradation process. A number of different exosome variants exist in the cell that are distinguished by the inclusion of their respective catalytic subunit(s): the main cytoplasmic exosome with DIS3L (CPX-592) or DIS3L and EXOSC10 (CPX-600), the main nuclear exosome with DIS3 and EXOSC10 (this complex), the nucleolar exosome with EXOSC10 (CPX-591) and a rare variant found in both, the nucleus and cytosol, (CPX-593). The nuclear RNA exosome is involved in a) proper maturation of most RNA species such as intron-removal from pre-mRNAs and tRNA precursors and rRNA, snRNA, snoRNA, lncRNA and enhancer RNA processing, especially the removal of their 3-prime ends, b) the elimination of RNA processing by-products and non-coding, cryptic transcripts, such as promoter-upstream transcripts (PROMPTs), enhancer RNAs (eRNAs), heterochromatin-forming repetitive elements (ribosomal DNA repeats and centromeres) and long non-coding RNAs, c) the elimination of mRNAs with processing defects and mRNAs that fail to undergo proper splicing or 3-prime end formation and d) gene expression either by mRNA processing or coordination of intron retention leading to regulation of decay of otherwise intact mRNAs. Nuclear exosome activity therefore limits or excludes export of target RNAs to the cytoplasm. Possibly involved in the degradation of mRNAs with defects in their co-transcriptional packaging into ribonucleoprotein particles (mRNPs), retention of aberrant transcripts on the chromatin, immunoglobulin (Ig) class switch recombination (CSR), Ig variable region somatic hypermutation (SHM) transcription termination or DNA damage repair processes. A small amount of this complex has also been found in the cytoplasm. 	The RNA exosome contains a catalytically inactive but evolutionarily conserved core complex of 9 subunits (Exo-9). This barrel-shaped Exo-9 is formed by a hexameric ring of RNase PH domain-containing subunits EXOSC4 (RRP41) - EXOSC9 (RRP45), EXOSC5 (RRP46) - EXOSC8 (RRP43) and EXOSC6 (MTR3) - EXOSC7 (RRP42), and a peripheral cap consisting of S1 domain-containing components EXOSC1 (CSL4), EXOSC2 (RRP4) and EXOSC3 (RRP40) located on the top of the ring structure. Exo-9 has no exoribonuclease activity although an active site created in the binding surface of EXOSC4-EXOSC9 may provide very low phosphorolytic activity. Exo-9 facilitates the binding and presentation of RNA for ribonucleolysis and serves as a scaffold for the association with the catalytic subunits. Full ribonuclease activity is only achieved when DIS3 (RRP44) and EXOSC10 (RRP6) bind to the base of Exo-9 and to its cap-side, respectively. Manganese(2+) (Mn2+, CHEBI:29035) may replace Mg2+ as cofactor.

The pregnane X receptor (NR1I2/PXR) is a central xenobiotic sensor that detects potentially toxic chemicals and regulates the expression of genes central to their breakdown and removal. NR1I2 binds as a heterodimer with the 9-cis retinoic acid receptor (RXRA) to xenobiotic response elements in cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A) gene promoters and is activated by the spectrum of chemicals that are known to induce CYP3A gene expression. Like other NRs, RXRA and NR1I2 contain DNA-binding and ligand-binding domain (DBD, LBD). Upon ligand binding, corepressors dissociate from RXRA and transcriptional coactivators, such as NCOA1 (Q15788), are recruited leading to transcriptional activation. 	All RXRA heterodimers cooperatively bind response elements composed of two hexameric half-sites arranged in a direct repeat configuration with characteristic inter-half-site spacings of 1-5 base-pairs (known as DR1-DR5, respectively), giving the complex specificity for a 12-mer motif. DR motifs are asymmetric and can be read in one direction only. RXRA and partner NR first dimerize, then bind to the DNA which involves polar functional groups in the minor grooves of DNA, as well as a well-ordered hydration spine associating with the DNA structure. A minor groove compression at the protein-protein junction is also electrostatically favorable. NR1I2-RXRA unusually forms a symmetric heterotetramer composed of two NR1I2 and two RXRA LBD monomers. The two NR1I2 monomers form a homodimer with a unique curved pocket and two RXRA monomers bind to NR1I2, one per monomer. Unusually for class II nuclear receptors, RXRA also forms transcriptionally active homodimers (CPX-664) although their physiological significance is not clear. Molecular weight = 210 kDa.

Plays a pivotal role during nervous system development and in various functions of mature central and peripheral nervous system. Regulates the NFAT signaling cascade by binding to and dephosphorylating NFAT leading to nuclear translocation of this larger complex and increasing the DNA-binding affinity of the NFAT family of transcription factors. Calcineurin also promotes nuclear retention of NFAT by masking nuclear export signals (NES) and preventing NES-dependent nuclear export. Altered calcineurin-NFAT activation can mediate both neuroprotective and neurodegenerative signals and is linked to pathological features of neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Huntingtons, Parkinsons, and Alzheimers diseases. Modulates Ca2+-dependent inactivation (CDI) of voltage-gated L-type Ca2+ channels. CDI is initiated by Ca2+ binding to channel-associated calmodulin and subsequent activation of calcineurin, which is targeted to L channels by the A-kinase-anchoring protein AKAP5 (CPX-674). Channel activity is activated by phosphorylation of AKAP5-bound Protein Kinase A.	Calcineurin substrates share a recognition sequence of the formula PxIxIT. At low calcium concentrations, the catalytic subunit (CnA) PPP3CA exists in an inactive state, where the autoinhibitory domain (AID) binds to the active-site cleft of the catalytic domain. Upon an increase in calcium concentration the regulatory subunits Calcineurin B (PPP3R1) and Calmodulin each bind four calcium ions causing a conformational change of the regulatory domain of CnA which leads to activation of the phosphatase.

Cleaves Complement C3 precurser (P01024) into anaphylatoxin C3A (P01024-PRO_0000005910) and nascent convertase core-component C3b (CPX-973). Restricted to the fluid-phase. C3(H2O)Bb convertase is very unstable and readily inactivated by Factor H (P08603) thus regulating the amount of spontaneously available C3 convertase initiating the alternative pathway. Lack of protection, due to familial mutations in the complement genes or the presence of autoantibodies against regulators has been linked to atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) and C3 glomerulopathies (C3G) in kidneys and age-related macular degeneration (AMD) in eyes. Conditions of chronic and acute inflammations, as in rheumatoid arthritis, strokes, and heart attacks, become aggravated by complement activation against the disturbed tissue. 	The alternative pathway is continuously activated at a low level. C3 precursor is first processed by the removal of 4 Arg residues and spontaneous hydrolysis due to the breakdown of the internal thioester bond forms C3(H2O) (disulfide bonded P01024-PRO_0000005909 & P01024-PRO_0000005908). C3(H2O) subsequently binds factor B that is cleaved by Factor D (P00746) into 2 fragments: CFBa and CFBb. CFBb, a serine protease, then combines with complement factor C3(H2O) or C3b to generate the C3 or C5 convertases. Proteolytic cleavage of C3 to C3b is accompanied by large conformational changes that result in the exposure of cryptic binding sites required for convertase assembly and regulation. This includes a significant movement of the thioester-bond-containing domain through which C3b attaches to target surfaces.

Important for many cellular activities such as homeostasis, angiogenesis, myogenesis, adipogenesis, osteogenesis, chondrocyte differentiation, cardiovascular system development, pancreatic beta-cell proliferation, hair follicle cell differentiation and remodeling, and activities of cells of the immune. Plays a pivotal role during nervous system development and in various functions of mature central and peripheral nervous system. Regulates the NFAT signaling cascade by binding to and dephosphorylating NFAT leading to nuclear translocation of this larger complex and increasing the DNA-binding affinity of the NFAT family of transcription factors. Calcineurin also promotes nuclear retention of NFAT by masking nuclear export signals (NES) and preventing NES-dependent nuclear export. Altered calcineurin-NFAT activation can mediate both neuroprotective and neurodegenerative signals and is linked to pathological features of neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Huntingtons, Parkinsons, and Alzheimers diseases. Modulates Ca2+-dependent inactivation (CDI) of voltage-gated L-type Ca2+ channels. CDI is initiated by Ca2+ binding to channel-associated calmodulin and subsequent activation of calcineurin, which is targeted to L channels by the A-kinase-anchoring protein AKAP5 (CPX-674). Channel activity is activated by phosphorylation of AKAP5-bound Protein Kinase A.	Calcineurin substrates share a recognition sequence of the formula PxIxIT. At low calcium concentrations, the catalytic subunit (CnA) PPP3CA exists in an inactive state, where the autoinhibitory domain (AID) binds to the active-site cleft of the catalytic domain. Upon an increase in calcium concentration the regulatory subunits Calcineurin B (PPP3R1) and Calmodulin each bind four calcium ions causing a conformational change of the regulatory domain of CnA which leads to activation of the phosphatase.

The formation of this complex results in altered cell adhesion, migration, survival and proliferation. Components of the plasminogen activation system including urokinase plasminogen activator uPA (PLAU) and its cell surface receptor uPAR (PLAUR) have been implicated in a wide variety of biological processes related to tissue homoeostasis. The high affinity binding of uPA regulates the binding of uPAR to matrix-embedded vitronectin. Activated uPA cleaves the zymogen plasminogen, generating the protease plasmin. uPA and plasmin induces a potent negative feedback on cell adhesion through specific cleavage of the RGD motif in vitronectin. Cleavage of vitronectin by uPA requires concomitant binding of both uPA and vitronectin to uPAR. 	uPAR binds simultaneously to uPA and the somatomedin B domain (SMB) of vitronectin. uPA binding to uPAR is mediated by a 25-residue beta-turn growth factor-like (EGF) domain that is ensconced in a large hydrophobic cavity lined with several residues that contribute more than an order of magnitude to the binding. SMB binds to the outer side of the receptor. The uPAR-uPA interaction is a tight, approximately 1 nM, and long-lived complex that occurs over a large protein-protein interface of more than 1,000 A2. In contrast, the uPAR-VTN interaction occurs over a smaller interface of 75 A2.

Facilitates the degradation of GAGs in lysosomes of the central and peripheral nervous system. Member of the Family 20 glycoside hydrolases (glycosidase). Active on water-soluble and amphiphilic glycoconjugates such as sulfated GAG fragments, and the sulfated glycosphingolipid SM2 (CHEBI:90163). Only the heterodimeric complex HEX A is able to remove N-acetylgalactosamine from the ganglioside GM2 (CHEBI:60327), a molecule composed of a glycosphingolipid with a single sialic acids linked on the sugar chain found in high concentrations in neuronal cell plasma membranes. Works in association with the GM2A (P17900) which extracts single GM2 molecules from membranes and presents them in soluble form to the enzyme or hydrolyses sulphated, membrane-bound substrates. Intra-lysosomal accumulation of GM2 ganglioside leads to severely debilitating neurodegeneration associated with Tay-Sachs disease, Sandoff disease and AB variant. 	An alpha-beta heterodimer, with each subunit having a functional active site. Beta subunit probably forms 2 chains. Only the alpha-subunit active site can hydrolyze GM2 gangliosides due to a flexible loop structure that is removed post-translationally from beta, and to the presence of Asn423 and Arg424 residues. The loop structure is involved in binding the GM2 activator protein, while alpha-Arg424 is critical for binding the carboxylate group of the N-acetyl-neuraminic acid residue of GM2. The beta-subunit lacks these key residues and has Asp452 and Leu453 in their place. The beta-subunit therefore cleaves only neutral substrates efficiently.

This enzymatic defect leads to abnormal GM2 ganglioside storage in neurons and peripheral tissues. Three variants have been described according to age of onset. The infantile form (type 1) begins between 3 and 6 months of age. The earliest sign is an incessant startle response to noise. Psychomotor retardation appears after the age of 8 months with hypotonia, amaurosis, and megalencephaly. A cherry-red macular spot may be found but is not specific. Muscular weakness progresses and leads to paralysis. The disorder degenerates into a state of decerebration and is fatal during childhood. Enzymatic activity of the hexosaminidase A is either extremely low or totally absent in leucocytes and cultured in fibroblasts obtained by skin biopsy. In the juvenile form (type 2), onset is between ages 2 and 6 with locomotor ataxia, behavioural disorders, and progressive loss of intellectual capacities, leading to a state of decerebration and death at around the age of 15. The decrease in hexosaminidase A activity is less pronounced than in the infantile form. The adult or chronic form (type 3) may begin around the age of 10, but often the disorder is not diagnosed until adulthood. Two different clinical forms exist. The first is similar to atypical Friedreich disease, with spinocerebellar ataxia but no cardiac or osseous signs, such as scoliosis or flat feet. The second is that of juvenile spinal amyotrophy resembling Kugelberg-Welander's syndrome. Mental capacities and behaviour may or may not be affected.|Sandhoff disease (GM2 gangliosidosis 0 variant, Hexosaminidases A and B deficiency) [Orphanet:796]: an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder that results from hexosaminidase A and B deficiency, linked to an abnormal beta subunit (while Tay-Sachs disease results from hexosaminidase A deficiency caused by an abnormal alpha subunit). This enzymatic defect leads to abnormal GM2 ganglioside storage in neurons and peripheral tissues. The clinical picture is identical to that of Tay-Sachs disease, with startle reactions, early blindness, progressive motor and mental deterioration, macrocephaly and cherry-red spots on the macula. Patients may have a doll-like face, hepatosplenomegaly and recurring respiratory tract infections. High levels of urinary oligosaccharides are found. Children develop normally during the first 3-6 months of life, after which the disease appears and evolves quickly. Death usually occurring by age of 4 years. In cases with later onset, or in adult cases, signs may be those of spinocerebellous ataxia or dystonia. Intellectual capacities may or may not be affected.|GM2-gangliosidosis, AB variant (Hexosaminidase activator deficiency) [Orphanet:309246]: an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder that results from hexosaminidase A and B deficiency, linked to an abnormal alpha and beta subunits. This enzymatic defect leads to abnormal GM2 ganglioside storage in neurons and peripheral tissues. Variant AB is Tay-Sachs-like, but hexosaminidase A activity is normal but the enzyme activator required for hydrolysing GM2 is deficient.	-	-	-	psi-mi:"-"(ceitec)

The 9-cis retinoic acid receptor (retinoid X receptor, RXR) is an important member of the nuclear receptor family because it forms heterodimers with many other receptors, including the all-trans retinoic acid receptor (RAR). RAR and RXR transduce the retinoid signal into a variety of genetic responses, and their functions underlie the essential role played by retinoids in the development and homeostasis of vertebrates. In the absence of RAR agonist, the RXR-RAR heterodimer recruits the corepressor proteins NCoR or SMRT and associated factors such as histone deacetylases or DNA-methyl transferases that may lead to an inactive condensed chromatin structure, preventing transcription. RXRA-RARA is a non-permissive receptor that cannot be activated by an RXR agonist but only by an agonist of the dominant partner receptor, RARA. Upon RAR agonist binding, corepressors are released, and coactivator complexes such as histone acetyltransferases or histone arginine methyltransferases are recruited to activate transcription. The RXR-RAR heterodimer binds more efficiently to retinoic acid response elements (RAREs), composed typically of two direct repeats of a core hexameric motif, PuG [G/T] TCA, than do either of the homodimeric forms of RXR or RAR. 	All RXR heterodimers cooperatively bind response elements composed of two hexameric half-sites arranged in a direct repeat configuration with characteristic inter-half-site spacings of 1-5 base-pairs (known as DR1-DR5, respectively), giving the complex specificity for a 12-mer motif. DR motifs are asymmetric and can be read in one direction only. RXR-RAR complexes preferentially bind DR2 and DR5 but also associates with DR1 under specific conditions. RXR and partner NR first dimerize, then bind to the DNA which involves polar functional groups in the minor grooves of DNA, as well as a well-ordered hydration spine associating with the DNA structure.

Upon ligand binding, RXRs undergo a conformational change that results in the release of corepressors and transcriptional coactivators, such as NCOA2, are recruited to the LBD which activates transcription. 	Coactivator NCOA2 contains an LXXLL motif (where X is any amino acid) which forms strong ligand-dependent interactions with members of the retinoic acid receptor superfamily of proteins. Unusually for class II nuclear receptors, RXRA also forms transcriptionally active homodimers (CPX-664) although their physiological significance is not clear.

Important for many cellular activities such as homeostasis, angiogenesis, myogenesis, adipogenesis, osteogenesis, chondrocyte differentiation, cardiovascular system development, pancreatic beta-cell proliferation, hair follicle cell differentiation and remodeling, and activities of cells of the immune. Plays a pivotal role during nervous system development and in various functions of mature central and peripheral nervous system. Regulates the NFAT signaling cascade by binding to and dephosphorylating NFAT leading to nuclear translocation of this larger complex and increasing the DNA-binding affinity of the NFAT family of transcription factors. Calcineurin also promotes nuclear retention of NFAT by masking nuclear export signals (NES) and preventing NES-dependent nuclear export. Altered calcineurin-NFAT activation can mediate both neuroprotective and neurodegenerative signals and is linked to pathological features of neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Huntingtons, Parkinsons, and Alzheimers diseases. Modulates Ca2+-dependent inactivation (CDI) of voltage-gated L-type Ca2+ channels. CDI is initiated by Ca2+ binding to channel-associated calmodulin and subsequent activation of calcineurin, which is targeted to L channels by the A-kinase-anchoring protein AKAP5 (CPX-674). Channel activity is activated by phosphorylation of AKAP5-bound Protein Kinase A.	Calcineurin substrates share a recognition sequence of the formula PxIxIT. At low calcium concentrations, the catalytic subunit (CnA) PPP3CA exists in an inactive state, where the autoinhibitory domain (AID) binds to the active-site cleft of the catalytic domain. Upon an increase in calcium concentration the regulatory subunits Calcineurin B (PPP3R1) and Calmodulin each bind four calcium ions causing a conformational change of the regulatory domain of CnA which leads to activation of the phosphatase.

Positively regulates histone H3 acetylation, in particular H3K9, by recruiting several histone acetyltransferases (HATs), such as KAT2B (PCAF, Q92831), p300 (Q09472), and KAT2A (GCN5, Q92830). Binds to both ribosomal DNA promoters and coding regions. Facilitates RNA polymerase I and III transcription by preventing compaction of chromatin at rDNA loci allowing HATs to assemble. An open chromatin structure is a prerequisite for the binding of the RNA polymerase machinery and also the regulatory factor MYC (P01106), which activates both RNA pol I genes and RNA pol III genes. May also activate RNA polymerase II gene transcription. The different subunits of the complex potentially have specific roles that lead to the stepwise modification of chromatin, and may not all associate simultaneously with the BAZ1B-SMARCA5 core. The B-WICH assembly may thus represent a number of smaller complexes. At the start of the cell division process, when Pol I transcription is arrested, B-WICH is in a disassembled state due to the phosphorylation of BAZ1B. The complex assembles on the active gene during early G1 phase. Polymeric actin interacts with Pol I, an interaction that is required for transcription. One speculative model is that NM1 (O00159-3) interacts with actin and the rDNA via its C-terminus, generating local force that pulls the polymerase along the active gene. Once dissociated from actin, NM1 interacts with SMARCA5 in a BAZ1B-dependent manner, a mechanism that stabilizes the complex on the rDNA. Additional components then assemble into the B-WICH complex(es) mediated by specific RNA species. Particularly important during embryonic and neonatal development, especially for craniofacial features. 	NM1 (via its c-terminus) and SMARCA5 bind the complex to promoter and gene regions of several rDNAs. Binds several RNAs, among others: 5S rRNA, 7SL RNA, and 45S rRNA. SIRT7 (Q9NRC8) or RRN3 (TIFIA, Q9NYV6) may facilitate interaction of B-WICH with pol I. 	-	-	Williams-Beuren syndrome (Orphanet:904): a rare genetic disease characterised by a developmental disorder associating a cardiac malformation (most frequently supra valvular aortic stenosis, SVAS) in 75% of cases, psychomotor retardation, a characteristic facial dysmorphism and a specific cognitive and behavioural profile. BAZ1B is located in the Williams-Beuren syndrome (WBS) critical region. WBS results from a hemizygous deletion of several genes on chromosome 7q11.23, thought to arise as a consequence of unequal crossing over between highly homologous low-copy repeat sequences flanking the deleted region..

Acts as the decoding centre of the ribosome which brings mRNA and aminoacylated transfer (t)RNAs together, with the 16S ribosomal (r)RNA being required for the selection of the cognate tRNA.	The human ribosome (80S) has a molecular weight of 4.3 MDa: the large subunit (60S)(CPX-5183) consists of 28S, 5S and 5.8S rRNAs and 47 ribonucleproteins (RPs), while the small subunit (40S) possesses a single 18S rRNA chain and 32 RPs. Unlike yeast, in which the majority of RPs have paralogs due to genome duplications, only two of RPs have paralogs in humans. Some RP paralogs are shown to have different tissue specificity and, as in some case, to be mutual exclusive. Ribosome heterogeneity is not unique to the protein components of the ribosome: it can also occur at the level of rRNA. The rRNAs are encoded by multiple copies of ribosomal DNA (rDNA) on different chromosomes. Distinct rRNA usage has been suggested to correlate with different developmental stages. The core of the 40S subunit is formed by the 18S ribosomal RNA, whilst the ribosomal proteins create binding sites for the mRNA and the tRNA A-site, P-site and E-site. Whilst there is normally considered to be a single copy of each polymer in the mature ribosome, there is evidence that the composition can vary in response to physiological conditions, potentially altering the translational efficiency of distinct mRNAs.	-	-	-	-	-	-	psi-mi:"MI:0469"(IntAct)

Subunit KPNA6 specifically and directly binds to substrates containing either a simple or bipartite NLS motif. Docking of the importin/substrate complex to the nuclear pore complex (NPC) is mediated by KPNB1. KPNB1 binds to nucleoporin FxFG repeats and the complex is subsequently translocated through the pore by an energy requiring, RAN-dependent mechanism. At the nucleoplasmic side of the NPC, RAN-GTP (P62826) binds to KPNB1, the three components separate and KPNA6 and KPNB1 are re-exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm where GTP is hydrolysed. The directionality of nuclear import is thought to be conferred by an asymmetric distribution of the GTP- and GDP-bound forms of RAN between the cytoplasm and nucleus.

Like other NRs, RXRA contains DNA-binding and ligand-binding domain (DBD, LBD). In the absence of agonist, the complex recruits the corepressor proteins NCoR or SMRT and associated factors such as histone deacetylases or DNA-methyl transferases that may lead to an inactive condensed chromatin structure, preventing transcription. Upon ligand binding, RXRs undergo a conformational change that results in the release of corepressors and transcriptional coactivators, such as NCOA1, are recruited to the LBD which activates transcription.

The EJC remains stably bound at this position as the mature messenger ribonucleoprotein particle is exported to the cytoplasm, potentially promoting export through its close association with the TREX complex. Binds RNA primarily through EIF4A3, a sequence-independent DEAD box protein that grasps RNA stably only when associated with its partners, RBM8A/Y14 and MAGOHB which inhibit the DEAD-box protein EIF4A3 ATPase activity, trapping the ATP-bound EJC core onto spliced mRNA in a stable conformation. The EJC core serves as a binding platform for additional factors which together then interface with numerous machineries controlling mRNA export, translation, and decay. Discriminates between premature and normal translation termination events by providing architectural information regarding the position of (former) introns. When translation terminates on an mRNA upstream of at least one EJC, UPF3 (Q9H1J1/Q9BZI7) and its cofactors UPF1 (Q9H1J1) and UPF2 (Q9HAU5) orchestrate a series of events that destabilize the message by a process known as nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD).

Thyroid hormone receptors (TRs) regulate gene expression in response to thyroid hormone, predominantly triiodothyronine, T3. Thyroid hormones are essential for early development and also for metabolic balance. The 9-cis retinoic acid receptor (retinoid X receptor, RXR) is an important member of the nuclear receptor family because it forms heterodimers with many other receptors, including the all-trans retinoic acid receptor (RAR). Receptors bind to T3 response elements (TREs) via their DNA-binding domains (DBD) and contain a C-terminal ligand-binding domain (LBD) that binds the hormone. Unliganded receptor generally represses basal transcription. RXRA-THRA is a non-permissive receptor that cannot be activated by an RXR agonist but only by an agonist of the dominant partner receptor, THRA. Binding of THRA induces a conformation changes which allosterically silences RXR. Upon ligand binding, the LBD undergoes a conformational change that results in the release of corepressors, the recruitment of coactivators, and the activation of transcription. Several alternative splice product of THRA, for example variant alpha-2 (P10827-1), have alternative carboxyl-terminal domains, therefore are not capable of binding T3. THRA alpha-2 is not a functional TR but may act as an inhibitor of thyroid hormone action.	All RXR heterodimers cooperatively bind response elements composed of two hexameric half-sites arranged in a direct repeat configuration with characteristic inter-half-site spacings of 1-5 base-pairs (known as DR1-DR5, respectively), giving the complex specificity for a 12-mer motif. DR motifs are asymmetric and can be read in one direction only. RXR-TR complexes preferentially bind DR4 and may also bind to inverted repeats. RXR and partner nuclear receptors first dimerize, then bind to the DNA which involves polar functional groups in the minor grooves of DNA, as well as a well-ordered hydration spine associating with the DNA structure. A minor groove compression at the protein-protein junction is also electrostatically favorable. The structure of TR-T3 within TR-T3:RXR-9-cis retinoic acid is in a relative state of disorder and the observed kinetics of binding show that T3 dissociates more rapidly from TR-T3:RXR-9-cis retinoic acid than from TR-T3:RXR. It is proposed that 9-cis retinoic acid functions as an allosteric repressor of TR:RXR transactivation by stimulating conformational changes within the complex.

Calcineurin is important for cardiac development and pathophysiology, for nervous-system development and for some of the plastic changes in neurons that are believed to underlie learning and memory. AKAP5 recruits calcineurin to the vicinity of L-type Ca2+ channels for their activation by elevated Ca2+ entering the cell. AKAP5 balances the opposing effects of calcineurin and protein kinase A (PKA) (P17612) on neuronal voltage-gated L-type Ca2+ channels and coordinates the activities of calcineurin, PKA and PKC on a number of other channels and receptors. Despite its atypical PxIxIT calcineurin-recognition motif that confers stronger binding affinity by calcineurin than other substrates it allows for effective disengagement of calcineurin to couple channel activation with downstream signaling events. The calcineurin-AKAP5 complex has been shown to promote NFAT signaling. 	Calcineurin is a heterodimer consisting of calcineurin A (PPP3CA) and calcineurin B (PPP3R1) subunits.

It regulates the higher-order structure of chromatin, making chromatin more compact by removing acetyl groups from nucleosomes, and has important roles in the regulation of gene expression and DNA damage repair. The core of the complex is composed of six groups of proteins, each one with several paralogues (HDAC1/2, MTA1/2/3, RBBP4/7, GATAD2A/B, MBD2, and CHD3/4). Combinatorial assembly of these isoforms contributes to the targeting and function of the complex. It is currently not known whether GATAD2A/GATAD2B, RBBP4/RBBP7, and MTA1/MTA2/MTA3 form heterodimers/trimers or mutually exclusive homodimers/trimers. The CHD3/4 ATPase, utilizes energy derived from hydrolysis of ATP for DNA sliding and repositioning of nucleosomes. The second catalytic subunit, HDAC1/2 (histone deacetylase), deacetylates acetylated lysine residues of histone and non-histone proteins. This dual enzymatic activity is proposed to be important for the efficient formation of heterochromatin with densely packed hypoacetylated nucleosomes and the rapid termination of gene transcription. In addition to the well-described core subunits, a large number of proteins have been reported to interact with the NuRD complex, like DOC1 (O14519), KPNA2 (P52292), ZMYND8(Q9ULU4), ZNF512B/532/592/687(Q96KM6, Q9HCE3, Q92610, Q8N1G0), SALL4 (Q9UJQ4), PRMT5 (O14744), MEP50 (Q9BQA1). They also contribute to dictate the different biological functions of the NuRD complex. 	RBBP4 and RBBP7 interactions with the NuRD complex are salt-stable but detergent-sensitive and they partially dissociate from the NuRD complex in a subunit exchange assay, suggesting that they have a dynamic role in the complex.

The Vitamin D receptor (VDR) mediates the transcriptional effects of Vitamin D and plays a central role in calcium homeostasis. The 9-cis retinoic acid receptor (retinoid X receptor, RXR) is an important member of the nuclear receptor family because it forms heterodimers with many other receptors, including the all-trans retinoic acid receptor (RAR). Receptors bind to hormone response elements (HREs) via their DNA-binding domains (DBD) and contain a C-terminal ligand-binding domain (LBD) that binds the hormone. Unliganded VDR can occupy its response elements as a homodimer. RXRB-VDR is a non-permissive receptor that cannot be activated by an RXR agonist but only by an agonist of the dominant partner receptor, VDR. Upon binding of ligand, VDR forms a heterodimer with RXRB through their LBDs and binds to Vitamin D response elements. The ligand for RXRB, 9-cis retinoic acid, has the opposite effect of destabilizing the heterodimeric-DNA complex.	All RXR heterodimers cooperatively bind response elements composed of two hexameric half-sites arranged in a direct repeat configuration with characteristic inter-half-site spacings of 1-5 base-pairs (known as DR1-DR5, respectively), giving the complex specificity for a 12-mer motif. DR motifs are asymmetric and can be read in one direction only. RXR-VDR complexes preferentially bind DR3. RXR and partner NR first dimerize, then bind to the DNA which involves polar functional groups in the minor grooves of DNA, as well as a well-ordered hydration spine associating with the DNA structure. A minor groove compression at the protein-protein junction is also electrostatically favorable.

It regulates the higher-order structure of chromatin, making chromatin more compact by removing acetyl groups from nucleosomes, and has important roles in the regulation of gene expression, DNA damage repair and cell differentiation. The core of the complex is composed of six groups of proteins, each one with several paralogues (HDAC1/2, MTA1/2/3, RBBP4/7, GATAD2A/B, MBD3, and CHD3/4). Combinatorial assembly of these isoforms contributes to the targeting and function of the complex. It is currently not known whether GATAD2A/GATAD2B, RBBP4/RBBP7, and MTA1/MTA2/MTA3 form heterodimers/trimers or mutually exclusive homodimers/trimers. The CHD3/4 ATPase, utilizes energy derived from hydrolysis of ATP for DNA sliding and repositioning of nucleosomes. The second catalytic subunit, HDAC1/2 (histone deacetylase), deacetylates acetylated lysine residues of histone and non-histone proteins. This dual enzymatic activity is proposed to be important for the efficient formation of heterochromatin with densely packed hypoacetylated nucleosomes and the rapid termination of gene transcription. In addition to the well-described core subunits, a large number of proteins have been reported to interact with the NuRD complex, like DOC1 (O14519), KPNA2 (P52292), ZMYND8(Q9ULU4), ZNF512B/532/592/687(Q96KM6, Q9HCE3, Q92610, Q8N1G0), SALL4 (Q9UJQ4), PRMT5 (O14744), MEP50 (Q9BQA1).

RBBP4 and RBBP7 interactions with the NuRD complex are salt-stable but detergent-sensitive and they partially dissociate from the NuRD complex in a subunit exchange assay, suggesting that they have a dynamic role in the complex.

RNAs with complex secondary structures, particularly at the 3-prime end of the molecule, may have to be unwound or pre-processed by co-factors prior to entering the complex. Although some RNAs may be targeted directly to the catalytic subunits, the majority of substrates enter the barrel-like structure of the exosome through a pore at the centre of the cap and are threaded through the central channel in a 3-prime to 5-prime orientation. The exoribonuclease activity of the catalytic subunits facilitates the degradation process. A number of different exosome variants exist in the cell that are distinguished by the inclusion of their respective catalytic subunit(s): the main cytoplasmic exosome with DIS3L (CPX-592) or DIS3L and EXOSC10 (this complex), the main nuclear exosome with DIS3 and EXOSC10 (CPX-476), the nucleolar exosome with EXOSC10 (CPX-591) and a rare variant found in both, the nucleus and cytosol, (CPX-593). The cytoplasmic RNA exosome is involved in general mRNA turnover (esp of Polymerase III transcripts) and specifically degrades inherently unstable mRNAs containing AU-rich elements (AREs) within their 3-prime untranslated regions and cytoplasmic rRNAs that have undergone polyadenylation.

Exo-9 has no exoribonuclease activity although an active site created in the binding surface of EXOSC4-EXOSC9 may provide very low phosphorolytic activity. Exo-9 facilitates the binding and presentation of RNA for ribonucleolysis and serves as a scaffold for the association with the catalytic subunits. Full exoribonuclease activity is only achieved when DIS3L and EXOSC10 (RRP6) bind to the base of Exo-9 and to its cap-side, respectively.

Thyroid hormone receptors (TRs) regulate gene expression in response to thyroid hormone, predominantly triiodothyronine, T3. Thyroid hormones are essential for early development and also for metabolic balance. The 9-cis retinoic acid receptor (retinoid X receptor, RXR) is an important member of the nuclear receptor family because it forms heterodimers with many other receptors, including the all-trans retinoic acid receptor (RAR). Receptors bind to T3 response elements (TREs) via their DNA-binding domains (DBD) and contain a C-terminal ligand-binding domain (LBD) that binds the hormone. Both THRB isoforms contribute to T3 feedback on thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), with THRB1 having a more important role in the activation of TRH transcription. Unliganded receptor generally represses basal transcription. Unliganded receptor generally represses basal transcription. RXRA-THRB is a non-permissive receptor that cannot be activated by an RXR agonist but only by an agonist of the dominant partner receptor, THRB. Binding of THRB induces a conformation changes which allosterically silences RXR. Upon ligand binding, the LBD undergoes a conformational change that results in the release of corepressors, the recruitment of coactivators, and the activation of transcription. 	All RXR heterodimers cooperatively bind response elements composed of two hexameric half-sites arranged in a direct repeat configuration with characteristic inter-half-site spacings of 1-5 base-pairs (known as DR1-DR5, respectively), giving the complex specificity for a 12-mer motif. DR motifs are asymmetric and can be read in one direction only. RXR-TR complexes preferentially bind DR4 and may also bind to inverted repeats. RXR and partner nuclear receptors first dimerize, then bind to the DNA which involves polar functional groups in the minor grooves of DNA, as well as a well-ordered hydration spine associating with the DNA structure. A minor groove compression at the protein-protein junction is also electrostatically favorable. DR4 DNA accommodates the RXR-TR DBD heterodimer as B-form DNA without significant distortion. The four intervening base pairs in the DNA response element place the centers of the hexameric repeats ten base pairs apart, nearly one full turn of the DNA helix. The bound DBDs engage the major grooves of successive repeats with the same geometry, placing them on the same face of the DR4 target. Contacts between the RXR DBD and the TR DBD straddle the minor groove of the spacer. Residues from the second zinc molecule of the RXR DBD are positioned at the upstream side of the interface, and interact with residues from the first zinc module and the T region of the TR DBD.

Liver X receptors (LXR) function as transcription factors that mediate cholesterol, glucose and lipid metabolism and reverse cholesterol transport. The 9-cis retinoic acid receptor (retinoid X receptor, RXR) is an important member of the nuclear receptor family because it forms heterodimers with many other receptors, including the all-trans retinoic acid receptor (RAR). The effects of ligands on LXR, RXR, and other NRs are mediated through the ligand-binding domain (LBD). Upon ligand binding, the LBD undergoes a conformational change that results in the release of corepressors, the recruitment of coactivators, and the activation of transcription. 	All RXR heterodimers cooperatively bind response elements composed of two hexameric half-sites arranged in a direct repeat configuration with characteristic inter‐half‐site spacings of 1-5 base-pairs (known as DR1-DR5, respectively), giving the complex specificity for a 12-mer motif. DR motifs are asymmetric and can be read in one direction only. RXR and partner NR first dimerize, then bind to the DNA which involves polar functional groups in the minor grooves of DNA, as well as a well-ordered hydration spine associating with the DNA structure. A minor groove compression at the protein-protein junction is also electrostatically favorable. RXR-LXR complexes preferentially bind DR4. RXR and partner NR first dimerize, then bind to the DNA which involves polar functional groups in the minor grooves of DNA, as well as a well-ordered hydration spine associating with the DNA structure. A minor groove compression at the protein-protein junction is also electrostatically favorable. The LBDs share a common, mainly alpha-helical, fold that embeds a hydrophopic ligand-binding pocket. Ligands can affect the conformation of the ligand-dependent activation function 2 (AF-2) residing in the C-terminal alpha helix. An agonist allows this alpha helix to cover the ligand-binding pocket, thereby providing one of the sides in the coactivator-binding pocket. Conversely, an antagonist induces a conformation change blocking the coactivator-binding site and/or leading to recruitment of corepressors.

The 9-cis retinoic acid receptor (retinoid X receptor, RXR) is an important member of the nuclear receptor family because it forms heterodimers with many other receptors, including the all-trans retinoic acid receptor (RAR). RAR and RXR transduce the retinoid signal into a variety of genetic responses, and their functions underlie the essential role played by retinoids in the development and homeostasis of vertebrates. A general model of RAR-RXR-mediated transcription proposes that unliganded RAR-RXR heterodimers are bound to regulatory elements of their target genes and interact with transcriptional repressor complexes such as NCOR/SMRT/SIN3 to recruit histone deacetylases that lead to repression of target gene transcription. Binding of agonist ligand to the nuclear receptor, triggers a conformational change in the ligand binding domain (LBD) with the repositioning of the C-terminal helix H12 creating a binding surface that allow coactivator to bind. Antagonist ligands that prevent the C-terminal helix H12 from adopting its active conformation facilitate the interactions with corepressors.

Genotoxic stress, mitotic catastrophe, heat shock, ER stress or bacterial toxins can stimulate Caspase-2 activation. It is activated by autocatalytic cleavage in the Caspase-2-PIDDosome (CPX-3905). Once activated, it is released from the PIDDosome and induces BID (P55957) cleavage, BAX (Q07812) translocation to mitochondria, subsequent Cytochrome c (P99999) release and consequent activation of the apoptotic process.

Caspase-2 is negatively regulated by phosphorylation at distinct sites (Ser157 and Ser340) during cell division and in nutrient abundance conditions. In response to heat shock, Caspase-2 activity is suppressed by the chaperone HSP90AA1(P07900).

Restricted to processing linear and circular single-stranded RNAs only. RNAs with complex secondary structures, particularly at the 3-prime end of the molecule, may have to be unwound or pre-processed by co-factors prior to entering the complex. Although some RNAs may be targeted directly to the catalytic subunit, the majority of substrates enter the barrel-like structure of the exosome through a pore at the centre of the cap and are threaded through the central channel in a 3-prime to 5-prime orientation. The exoribonuclease activity of the catalytic subunit facilitates the degradation process. A number of different exosome variants exist in the cell that are distinguished by the inclusion of their respective catalytic subunit(s): the main cytoplasmic exosome with DIS3L (this complex) or DIS3L and EXOSC10 (CPX-600), the main nuclear exosome with DIS3 and EXOSC10 (CPX-476), the nucleolar exosome with EXOSC10 (CPX-591) and a rare variant found in both, the nucleus and cytosol, (CPX-593). The cytoplasmic RNA exosome is involved in general mRNA turnover (esp of Polymerase III transcripts) and specifically degrades inherently unstable mRNAs containing AU-rich elements (AREs) within their 3-prime untranslated regions and cytoplasmic rRNAs that have undergone polyadenylation. Degrades mRNAs subject to RNA interference and is involved in the following mRNA decay pathways: mRNAs with premature termination codons (PTCs; the nonsense mediated decay (NMD) pathway), ones lacking termination codons altogether (the non-stop decay (NSD) pathway) and ones where ribosomes stall (the no-go decay (NGD) pathway). Seems to be involved in degradation of histone mRNA. 	The RNA exosome contains a catalytically inactive but evolutionarily conserved core complex of 9 subunits (Exo-9). This barrel-shaped Exo-9 is formed by a hexameric ring of RNase PH domain-containing subunits EXOSC4 (RRP41) - EXOSC9 (RRP45), EXOSC5 (RRP46) - EXOSC8 (RRP43) and EXOSC6 (MTR3) - EXOSC7 (RRP42), and a peripheral cap consisting of S1 domain-containing components EXOSC1 (CSL4), EXOSC2 (RRP4) and EXOSC3 (RRP40) located on the top of the ring structure. Exo-9 has no exoribonuclease activity although an active site created in the binding surface of EXOSC4-EXOSC9 may provide very low phosphorolytic activity. Exo-9 facilitates the binding and presentation of RNA for ribonucleolysis and serves as a scaffold for the association with the catalytic subunit. Full exoribonuclease activity is only achieved when DIS3L binds to the base of Exo-9.

The TBP subunit of TFIID recognizes and binds to the TATA box (if present), while TAF1 and TAF2 interact with the Initiator element (Inr), and TAF1 and the TAF6-TAF9 module recognizes the downstream core promoter element (DPE). Other core promoter elements, such as the motif ten element (MTE), may also be involved. Binding of the general transcription factor complex TFIIA (CPX-519) enhances binding of TFIID to the core promoter and nucleates pre-initiation complex (PIC) assembly. Following recruitment of TFIIA to TFIID, TFIIB, TFIIF (CPX-79), Pol II, TFIIE and TFIIH are successively assembled at the core promoter, allowing the PIC to initiate Pol II transcription. While TFIID is essential for transcription and its post-mitotic reinitiation, the loss of one or more subunits does not harm ongoing transcription during any given cell cycle. TFIID promoter binding appears to be regulated by histone modifications: TAF1 bromodomains (1361-1617 aa, IPR001487) bind the modified histone tails of acetylated H4K16, H4K5/K12 and H4K8/K16. TAF1 also appears to exhibit histone acetyltransferase activity towards histones H3 and H4. TAF3 and the PHD domains of other TFIID subunits bind modified histone tails carrying trimethylated H3K4 in combination with acetylated H3K9 and H3K14. TAF1 phosphorylates TP53 (P046370) on Thr-55, leading to TP53 degradation and G1 cell cycle progression. 	Variant of the canonical TFIID complex (CPX-915) containing TAF4B instead of TAF4. Thought to have the same function as the canonical complex. TFIID can be divided into three lobes, A, B and C which arrange around a central cavity. The conformation of lobe A relative to lobes B and C changes as TFIID binds to both, TFIIA (CPX-519) and the core promoter, enhancing its DNA-binding capacity. In the canonical (or unbound) state, TATA-box binding protein TBP of lobe A binds the TAF1-TAF7 subcomplex of lobe C. Binding of TFIIA complex to TBP forms the rearranged (or promoter-bound) state, whereby lobe A is released from lobe C and binds proximal to lobe B and to the TATA-box. During this conformational change TBP is released from binding to TAF1 but its B lobe binding partner(s) are as yet to be determined. Lobe C contains at least TAF1, TAF2, TAF6, TAF7 and TAF8. The winged helix domain of TAF1 forms a major interaction at the junction of the downstream promoter elements MTE and DPE and the aminopeptidase-like domain (APD) of TAF2 domain 3 interacts with the MTE. TAF6 forms a homodimer that, together with TAF8, binds TAF2 of lobe C to lobe B. A core complex, formed by histone-fold domain (HFD)-containing subunits from lobes B and C, links the TAF1-TAF2-TAF7 subcomplex of lobe C to lobe A. It contains at least the HFD-containing heterodimers TAF4B-TAF12 (x2), TAF6-TAF9 (x2), TAF8-TAF10 and TAF11-TAF13 as well as two TAF5 subunits that appear to form the scaffold for the heterodimers.

Composed by binding of the extracellular domains of two presynaptic neurexin proteins and two postsynaptic neuroligin proteins. Expression of both subunits is regulated by neuronal activity. Required for synaptic differentiation, maturation and maintenance, dendritic spine remodelling and axon arborisation. Possibly required for synapse formation. Mediates bidirectional synaptic signalling and coupling of presynaptic, Ca2+-dependent synaptic vesicle exocytosis (= neurotransmitter release) with postsynaptic neurotransmitter receptor recruitment. Acts as a molecular switch between excitatory and inhibitory synapses: this complex acts primarily, but not exclusively, on GABAergic, inhibitory synapses that mainly release neurotransmitters GABA and glycine. Mainly found in synaptic clefts of the central nervous system but also at neuromuscular junctions (particularly alpha neurexin-containing complexes). Mutations in the neuroligin dimer interface as well as allosteric affects of mutation in both subunits affect spacial and fear-associated memory and result in autism-related disorders, mental retardation disorders and schizophrenia. 	Heterotetramer composed of 2 neuroligin and 2 neurexin subunits. Each neurexin monomer binds to opposite sites of the central neuroligin dimer in a Ca2+-dependent manner. The effect of Ca2+ on the intermolecular binding is proposed to be allosteric as Ca2+ does not bind directly to neuroligin residues. The subunits bind to each other via the neuroligin ACHE domain and neurexin LNS domains (LNS6 of alpha-neurexins and sole LNS of beta-neurexins). In mammals, there are 3-5 neuroligin genes and 3 neurexin genes. Neuroligin 4 (= neuroligin X) and neuroligin Y have only been characterised in human, with little information available for neuroligin Y. Neuroligin 1 contains 2 splice sites (SSA & SSB), neuroligins 2 & 3 contain 1 splice site (SSA) and neuroligin 4/X probably contains no splice site. Each neurexin gene produces from independent promoters a longer alpha- and a shorter beta neurexin isoform. Alpha-neurexins contain 5 splice sites (SS1-SS5) and beta-neurexins contain 2 splice sites (SS4 & SS5) which leads to almost 4000 potential neurexin variants alone. The most common variants affecting binding and function are restricted to the presence or absence of neuroligin SSB (restricted to neuroligin 1) and neurexin SS4. These combinations are curated in this resource. N-glycosylation of neuroligin SSB (mainly on Asn300 [count based on NLGN1+SSA+SSB]) reduces binding to beta-neurexin SS4 and abolishes binding to alpha-neurexin SS4 as the intermolecular interfaces are proximal to these respective splice insertions.

The TBP subunit of TFIID recognizes and binds to the TATA box (if present), while TAF1 and TAF2 interact with the Initiator element (Inr), and TAF1 and the TAF6-TAF9 module recognizes the downstream core promoter element (DPE). Other core promoter elements, such as the motif ten element (MTE), may also be involved. Binding of the general transcription factor complex TFIIA (CPX-519) enhances binding of TFIID to the core promoter and nucleates pre-initiation complex (PIC) assembly. Following recruitment of TFIIA to TFIID, TFIIB, TFIIF (CPX-79), Pol II, TFIIE and TFIIH are successively assembled at the core promoter, allowing the PIC to initiate Pol II transcription. While TFIID is essential for transcription and its post-mitotic reinitiation, the loss of one or more subunits does not harm ongoing transcription during any given cell cycle. TFIID promoter binding appears to be regulated by histone modifications: TAF1 bromodomains (1361-1617 aa, IPR001487) bind the modified histone tails of acetylated H4K16, H4K5/K12 and H4K8/K16. TAF1 also appears to exhibit histone acetyltransferase activity towards histones H3 and H4. TAF3 and the PHD domains of other TFIID subunits bind modified histone tails carrying trimethylated H3K4 in combination with acetylated H3K9 and H3K14. TAF1 phosphorylates TP53 (P04637) on Thr-55, leading to TP53 degradation and G1 cell cycle progression. Spermatocytes contain variants of TAF-containing complexes, including the TAF4B variant (CPX-930). 	TFIID can be divided into three lobes, A, B and C which arrange around a central cavity. The conformation of lobe A relative to lobes B and C changes as TFIID binds to both, TFIIA (CPX-519) and the core promoter, enhancing its DNA-binding capacity. In the canonical (or unbound) state, TATA-box binding protein TBP of lobe A binds the TAF1-TAF7 subcomplex of lobe C. Binding of TFIIA complex to TBP forms the rearranged (or promoter-bound) state, whereby lobe A is released from lobe C and binds proximal to lobe B and to the TATA-box. During this conformational change TBP is released from binding to TAF1 but its B lobe binding partner(s) are as yet to be determined. Lobe C contains at least TAF1, TAF2, TAF6, TAF7 and TAF8. The winged helix domain of TAF1 forms a major interaction at the junction of the downstream promoter elements MTE and DPE and the aminopeptidase-like domain (APD) of TAF2 domain 3 interacts with the MTE. TAF6 forms a homodimer that, together with TAF8, binds TAF2 of lobe C to lobe B. A core complex, formed by histone-fold domain (HFD)-containing subunits from lobes B and C, links the TAF1-TAF2-TAF7 subcomplex of lobe C to lobe A. It contains at least the HFD-containing heterodimers TAF4-TAF12 (x2), TAF6-TAF9 (x2), TAF8-TAF10 and TAF11-TAF13 as well as two TAF5 subunits that appear to form the scaffold for the heterodimers. However, the HFD-containing heterodimers may be too far apart from each other to form histone-like tetramer and octamer structures. The core complex forms a clamp in which the remaining subunits assemble dynamically. TAF4 can be replaced by TAF4B (Q92750) with TFIID remaining functional. TAF7 may get released from the PIC without loosing complex integrity and transcription initiation.

METTL3 and METTL14 bind via 2 distinct but adjacent interfaces, the core of the interface is formed by strands beta4-beta5 and helix alpha4 of each MTase domain. METTL14 acts as the RNA-binding scaffold that recognizes the substrate aiding its binding to METTL3. mRNA binds METTL3 via two gates that are adjacent to the METTL14 binding interface. METTL3 is the catalytic subunit of the complex, whilst METTL14 has a degenerate active site and plays a non-catalytic role in maintaining complex integrity and substrate RNA binding. WTAP appears to serve as a regulatory subunit. VIRMA plays a role in mediating mRNA m6A methylation in the 3-prime UTR and near the stop codon.

Complement C3 precurser is activated by cleavage into C3a and C3b by C3 convertases, either C4bC2a in the classical and lectin pathways or C3(H2O)Bb, C3bBb, C3bBbC3b, C3bBbP or C3bBbC3bP in the alternative pathway. C3b acts as an opsonin and interacts with glycoproteins and carbohydrates on pathogenic or apoptotic target cell surfaces through its reactive thioester moiety. Opsonization of target cells leads to enhanced phagocytosis, lysis of target cells via membrane attack complex assembly, clearance of antibody-antigen complexes and up-regulation of the adaptive response. Activation of C3b leads to an amplification cascade that generates more C3 convertase, deposits more C3b at the local site and switches C3 convertases to C5 convertases. To protect host cells from inadvertent complement activation the activation of C3b is tightly regulated by either disrupting the C3 convertases or aiding in the proteolytic degradation of C3b. Bacteria and viruses possess C3b proteases to evade the complement response. Lack of protection, due to familial mutations in the complement genes or the presence of autoantibodies against regulators has been linked to atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) and C3 glomerulopathies (C3G) in kidneys and age-related macular degeneration (AMD) in eyes. Conditions of chronic and acute inflammations, as in rheumatoid arthritis, strokes, and heart attacks, become aggravated by complement activation against the disturbed tissue.	The alternative pathway is continuously activated at a low level. C3 precursor is first processed by the removal of 4 Arg residues and spontaneous hydrolysis due to the breakdown of the internal thioester bond forms C3(H2O) (disulfide bonded P01024-PRO_0000005909 & P01024-PRO_0000005908). C3(H2O) subsequently binds factor B that is cleaved by Factor D (P00746) into 2 fragments: CFBa and CFBb. CFBb, a serine protease, then combines with complement factor C3(H2O) or C3b to generate the C3 or C5 convertases. Proteolytic cleavage of C3 to C3b is accompanied by large conformational changes that result in the exposure of cryptic binding sites required for convertase assembly and regulation. This includes a significant movement of the thioester-bond-containing domain through which C3b attaches to target surfaces.

Exo-9 has no exoribonuclease activity although an active site created in the binding surface of EXOSC4-EXOSC9 may provide very low phosphorolytic activity. Exo-9 facilitates the binding and presentation of RNA for ribonucleolysis and serves as a scaffold for the association with the catalytic subunit. Full ribonuclease activity is only achieved when DIS3 (RRP44) binds to the base of Exo-9. Manganese(2+) (Mn2+, CHEBI:29035) may replace Mg2+ as cofactor.

This oligomer of protein 42 only has positive neurogenetic effects by activating synaptic protein kinases. May have a role in depressing synaptic activity thus preventing excitotoxicity. Influences synaptic plasticity through various receptors, including NMDAR, mGluR and alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (CPX-236). Mediates dendritic spine loss leading to decreased synapse density, inhibition of long-term potentiation (LTP), enhancement of long-term depression (LTD), excessive calcium influx, mitochondrial impairment, endoplasmic reticulum stress and activation of apoptotic processes. May bind plasma membrane lipids affecting their stability and leading to cytotoxicity. May affect metal ion homeostasis by chelating synaptic copper, zinc or iron ions. Mostly found in the extracellular space with a small proportion occurring as membrane-bound species. Dimers (CPX-1062) and oligomers of soluble amyloid-beta peptides are the main pathogenic species linked to Alzheimer's disease. Cellular prion protein (PrPC/PRNP, P04156) binds amyloid-beta oligomers mediating their synaptic dysfunction. Insoluble fibrils and plaques form during the latter stages of the disease. Chaperones, such as alphaB-crystallins or clusterin (P10909), bind to misfolded oligomeric species and form long-lived complexes, thereby preventing both their further growth into fibrils and their dissociation into synaptotoxic dimers. Amyloid-beta peptide may act as transcription factor for its own precursor protein APP and its cleavage enzyme BACE1 (P56817) initiating a positive feedback mechanism that ultimately leads to amyloidogenesis and Alzheimer's disease. 	Many forms of amyloid-beta oligomers exist in a dynamic equilibrium: from low-n amyloid-beta oligomer complexes such as dimers and trimers to high-n amyloid-beta oligomer complexes, such as pre-fibrilar and fibrilar oligomers to inactive fibrils. Pre-fibrilar oligomers form random coils and beta-turns and fibrils and oligomeric fibrils form anti-parallel beta-sheets. The oligomers are inherently thermodynamically more stable than the dimers.

Responsible for the catalytic activity of the ribosome, the peptidyltransferase activity required to catalyze peptide bond formation. The nascent polypeptides leave the ribosome through a tunnel in the LSU and interact with protein factors that function in enzymatic processing, targeting, and the membrane insertion of nascent chains at the exit of the ribosomal tunnel.	The human ribosome (80S) has a molecular weight of 4.3 MDa: the large subunit (60S) consists of 28S, 5S and 5.8S rRNAs and 47 ribonucleproteins (RPs), while the small subunit (40S) (CPX-5223) possesses a single 18S rRNA chain and 33 RPs. Unlike yeast, in which the majority of RPs have paralogs due to genome duplications, only six of RPs have paralogs in humans. Some RP paralogs are shown to have different tissue specificity and, as in the case of RPL3/RPL3L and RPL22/RPL22L1, to be mutual exclusive. Ribosome heterogeneity is not unique to the protein components of the ribosome: it can also occur at the level of rRNA. The rRNAs are encoded by multiple copies of ribosomal DNA (rDNA) on different chromosomes. Distinct rRNA usage has been suggested to correlate with different developmental stages. A distinct lateral protuberance called the stalk is located on the large ribosomal subunit and plays a central role in the ribosome-mediated stimulation of translation factor-dependent GTP hydrolysis. The 5 acidic ribosomal P-proteins form the pentameric stalk.	-	-	-	-	-	-	psi-mi:"MI:0469"(IntAct)

The precise process is undefined but the complex appears to reduce the superhelicity of the promoter region DNA around nucleosomes and may produce short DNA loops that are detached from the the nucleosomes, enabling access to the promoter region for a range of transcription factors and the pre-initiation complex (PIC). The complex also plays a role in double-strand break and nucleotide excision repair mechanisms and in the decatenation of newly replicated sister chromatids, a requirement for proper chromosome segregation during mitosis. Also targeted to chromatin by phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate which promotes the complex binding to actin filaments. The complex additionally interacts with a range of nuclear receptors and the vitamin D receptor (VDR, P11473) via SMARCD subunits. The neuron-specific SWI/SNF complex is critical for the proliferation of post-mitotic neurons and regulates genes specific for dendritic growth by binding tightly with CREST (O75177). In this variant of the complex transcriptional repression is probably driven by the presence of the ARID1A subunit. During neural development a switch from a progenitor to a post-mitotic chromatin remodeling mechanism occurs as neurons exit the cell cycle and become committed to their adult state. This process requires a switch of two subunits: ACTL6A (O96019) is replaced by ACTL6B and PHF10 (Q8WUB8) replaced by DPF1 or DPF3 in neuron-specific SWI/SNF complexes. The SWI/SNF complexes have been reported as consisting of 8 to 14 subunits. It is likely that the two ATPases, SMARCA2/BRM (this complex) and SMARCA4/BRG1 (CPX-1216) do not co-occur in the same complex. SMARCD1 (BAF60A) and SMARCD3 (BAF60C) as well as DPF1 and DPF3 also may not co-occur. Mutations in several subunits affect tissue and developmental processes such as nervous system and cardiac development and maintenance of pluripotency resulting in tumorigenesis or the development of intellectual disorders. 	MW approximately 2 MDa. May contain 2 instances of each subunit as calculated total MW for all subunits is approximately 1 MDa. While the complex is recruited to chromatin by lineage-specific transcription factors it also binds directly to the DNA via several of its subunits, such as ARID1A, SMARCB1 and SMARCE1. SMARCE1 also has DNA binding-bending activity.

MIF4GD subunit interacts with EIF4G1 (Q04637) and EIF4G2 (P78344), components of eIF4F complex, the cytoplasmic cap-binding complex that binds the 5-prime histone mRNA cap. EIF4G1/2 binding facilitates the circularisation of hmRNA that is required for its translation. Acts exclusively during G1/S transition when histones are in greatest demand. Both, the complex and hmRNA are degraded at the end of S phase when Thr-61 and Thr-62 of SLBP are phosphorylated. Translation of histones during other cell phases cause defects and can be toxic to the cell. 	SLBP is probably bound to the stem-loop structure of histone mRNA (hmRNA) throughout its life cycle (via its RNA-binding domain (RBD), IPR029344). hmRNA binding requires SLBP phosphorylation, specifically on Thr-171, but maybe other sites, too. It is not clear if MIF4GD already binds SLIP1 during pre-mRNA processing or only once the mRNA is exported into the cytoplasm. SLBP binds MIF4GD via its translation activation region. MIF4GD is essential for translation initiation and dissociates from SLBP before mRNA degradation commences. The active complex is probably a dimer as SLBP phosphorylation is incompatible with its dimerisation in the heterotetramer. Inactive, unphosphorylated heterotetamers have been observed but are contrary to the hypothesis of sequential binding of SLBP followed by MIF4GD on hmRNA. Additionally, MIF4GD dimers have been observed and may be required for the mRNA circularisation by binding SLBP and EIF4G1/2 simultaneously via its respective SMB domains.

Cellular prion protein (PrPC/PRNP, P04156) binds amyloid-beta oligomers mediating their synaptic dysfunction. Insoluble fibrils and plaques form during the latter stages of the disease. Chaperones, such as alphaB-crystallins or clusterin (P10909), bind to misfolded oligomeric species and form long-lived complexes, thereby preventing both their further growth into fibrils and their dissociation into synaptotoxic dimers. Amyloid-beta peptide may act as transcription factor for its own precursor protein APP and its cleavage enzyme BACE1 (P56817) initiating a positive feedback mechanism that ultimately leads to amyloidogenesis and Alzheimer's disease. 	Many forms of amyloid-beta oligomers exist in a dynamic equilibrium: from low-n amyloid-beta oligomer complexes such as dimers and trimers to high-n amyloid-beta oligomer complexes, such as pre-fibrilar and fibrilar oligomers to inactive fibrils.

The neural progenitor-specific SWI/SNF complex is critical for self-renewal, maintenance and pluripotency of neural progenitor stem cells by selectively activating or repressing its target genes. In this variant of the complex transcriptional repression is probably driven by the presence of the ARID1A subunit. During neural development a switch from a progenitor to a post-mitotic chromatin remodeling mechanism occurs as neurons exit the cell cycle and become committed to their adult state. This process requires a switch of two subunits: ACTL6A is replaced by ACTL6B (O94805) and PHF10 replaced by DPF1 (Q92782) or DPF3 (Q92784) in neuron-specific SWI/SNF complexes. The SWI/SNF complexes have been reported as consisting of 8 to 14 subunits. Although similar in function to the embryonic stem cell-specific SWI/SNF complex (CPX-1195) the composition of the neural progenitor-specific SWI/SNF complexes is more similar to the standard SWI/SNF complexes. It is likely that the two ATPases, SMARCA2/BRM (CPX-1201) and SMARCA4/BRG1 (this complex) do not co-occur in the same complex. SMARCD1 (BAF60A) and SMARCD3 (BAF60C) also may not co-occur.

In some cases the proteolytic action activates the substrate, for example, it cleaves CDK5R1/p35 (Q15078) into its p25 form that is associated with Alzheimer's disease. Involved in cytoskeletal remodeling, signal transduction and implicated in cell cycle regulation and apoptosis. Finely-balanced calpain homeostasis is required as both over and under-activation causes disease. Calpain complexes recognise their substrates based on a short peptide sequence. Inhibited by the intrinsically-unstructured calpastatin (P20810) by its tight binding to the calpain catalytic subunit. 	Calpain (CAPN1/muCL) and its small regulatory subunit (CAPNS1/30K) bind via their respective 5th (of 5) EF-hand motifs. The N-terminus of CAPNS1 contains hydrophobic Gly-clusters, the Gly-rich domain. The catalytically-active cleft is rather deep and narrow which might explains calpain's preference for digesting inter-domain unstructured regions. It is formed by the two calpain protease core domains, PC1 and PC2, containing one Ca2+-binding sites per core. Calcium binding to several domains of both subunits releases the steric hindrance by allowing PC1 and PC2 to move closer to each other while the secondary structures remain essentially unchanged and may result in the dissociation of the small regulatory subunit from the catalytic subunits. Most other members of the calpain family of proteins do not require a regulatory subunit and are activated directly by calcium binding. 	-	Calcium ion (Ca2+, CHEBI:29108)	Muscular dystrophy [Orphanet:98473]: Muscular dystrophy (MD) refers to a group of more than 30 genetic diseases characterized by progressive weakness and degeneration of the skeletal muscles that control movement.|Cataract [EFO:0001059]: Partial or complete opacity of the crystalline lens of one or both eyes that decreases visual acuity and eventually results in blindness.

The precise process is undefined but the complex appears to reduce the superhelicity of the promoter region DNA around nucleosomes and may produce short DNA loops that are detached from the the nucleosomes, enabling access to the promoter region for a range of transcription factors and the pre-initiation complex (PIC). The complex also plays a role in double-strand break and nucleotide excision repair mechanisms and in the decatenation of newly replicated sister chromatids, a requirement for proper chromosome segregation during mitosis. Also targeted to chromatin by phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate which promotes the complex binding to actin filaments. The complex additionally interacts with a range of nuclear receptors and the vitamin D receptor (VDR, P11473) via SMARCD subunits. The neural progenitor-specific SWI/SNF complex is critical for self-renewal, maintenance and pluripotency of neural progenitor stem cells by selectively activating or repressing its target genes. In this variant of the complex transcriptional activation is probably driven by the presence of the ARID1B subunit. Removes Polycomb repressive complex 1 and 2 (PRC1 & PRC2) resulting in promoter activation via deubiquitination of H2AK119 and demethylation of H3K27. Activates, among others, transcription of oestrogen-responsive genes, glucocorticoid receptor-dependent genes and genes activating the Notch-signalling pathway. During neural development a switch from a progenitor to a post-mitotic chromatin remodeling mechanism occurs as neurons exit the cell cycle and become committed to their adult state. This process requires a switch of two subunits: ACTL6A is replaced by ACTL6B (O94805) and PHF10 replaced by DPF1 (Q92782) or DPF3 (Q92784) in neuron-specific SWI/SNF complexes. The SWI/SNF complexes have been reported as consisting of 8 to 14 subunits. Although similar in function to the embryonic stem cell-specific SWI/SNF complex the composition of the neural progenitor-specific SWI/SNF complexes is more similar to the standard SWI/SNF complexes. It is likely that the two ATPases, SMARCA2/BRM (CPX-1213) and SMARCA4/BRG1 (this complex) do not co-occur in the same complex. SMARCD1 (BAF60A) and SMARCD3 (BAF60C) also may not co-occur. It is not clear yet if DPF2/BAF45D (Q92785) is a member of the neural progenitor-specific SWI/SNF complex. Mutations in several subunits affect tissue and developmental processes such as nervous system and cardiac development and maintenance of pluripotency resulting in tumorigenesis or the development of intellectual disorders. 	MW approximately 2 MDa. May contain 2 instances of each subunit as calculated total MW for all subunits is approximately 1 MDa.

Directly impacts transcriptional regulation, in part potentially by phosphorylating the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerse II. The XRCC5/6 heterodimer binds ends of dsDNA and both recruits PRKDC to DNA double strand breaks and stimulates its kinase activity.	The structure of PRKDC consists of an N-terminal region, a circular cradle unit, and the kinase head domain. The N-terminal L-shaped region is further divided into the arm (residues 1-400) and the bridge (residues 401-890). The bridge connects to the top of the circular cradle and contacts the C-terminal head region. A front aperture is formed by the circular cradle and a bottom aperture is formed by the arm and the bottom part of the circular cradle and both are large enough to allow the passage of dsDNA. The XRCC5 globular domain binds at the arm region of PRKDCs, which is adjacent to the general location of the XRCC6/XRCC5 DNA-binding domains.

Its formation is triggered by the release of Cytochrome c (P99999) from the mitochondria in response to intrinsic cell death stimuli. When released, Cytochrome c binds to APAF1 in a 1:1 stoichiometry to trigger nucleotide exchange and stepwise assembly of a heptameric structure. Pro-Caspase-9 is then recruited to form a multimeric Apaf1-Cytochrome c - pro-Caspase-9 complex. Once recruited, pro-Caspase-9 undergoes auto-cleavage resulting in two subunits: p35 and a p10. This step leads to the formation of a proteolytically active Apoptosome.	The functional oligomerized apoptosome is a wheel-like structure that consists of a heptameric arrangement of APAF1 molecules. APAF1 consists of three fundamental units: a sensor for an apoptotic stimulus (WD40 repeats), an oligomerization unit (NB-ARC) and a caspase-recruitment domain (CARD). The formation of the apoptosome is dependent on cytochrome c and the nucleotide triphosphates ATP. TheWD40 domain of APAF1 interacts with cytochrome c. The NB-ARC region of APAF1 provides the scaffold of the oligomer, whereas the CARD domains are arranged in a ring-like manner (CARD disk) near the centre of the assembly, generating a platform competent of binding and activating Procaspase-9. The CARD disk in the fully active apoptosome is an arrangement with a final 4:3 or 4:4 APAF1-CARD/caspase-9-CARD complex.

Binding of osteoprotegerin to cytokine TNFSF11 prevents the cytokine from binding its receptor TNFRSF11A/RANK (Q9Y6Q6) and thus inhibits osteoclastogenesis. Bone homeostasis seems to depend on the local ratio between cytokine and decoy receptor. Osteoprotegerin may also play a role in preventing arterial calcification. Plays some as yet to-be-defined role in mammary gland physiology and hormone-driven epithelial proliferation during pregnancy and may act as a protective factor in bone microenvironment by preventing breast cancer-induced bone loss and reducing intra-osseous tumour growth.

It possesses single-strand endonuclease activity and double-strand-specific 3prime-5prime exonuclease activity, which are provided by MRE11.The complex may also be required for DNA damage signaling via activation of the ATM kinase (Q13315). In telomeres the MRN complex may modulate t-loop formation. MRN complex is part of the BRCA1-C complex (CPX-4441). MRE11, RAD50 and NBS1 are known tumor suppressors. Loss of function of any of these proteins results in genome instability. Defective MRN function has been linked to many types of cancer. Hypomorphic mutations in any of the human genes for MRN result in cancer predisposing genome-instability syndromes: mutations in the MRE11 and NBS1 genes cause ataxia telangiectasia-like disorder (ATLD) and Nijmegen breakage syndrome (NBS), respectively.	MRN complex has a distinct architecture consisting of a large globular domain, from which two 40 to 50 nm arms protruded. The core of the MRN complex is composed by two RAD50 and two MRE11 subunits. Within each RAD50 subunit the N-terminal Walker A and the C-terminal Walker B nucleotide binding motifs stably associate with one another to form a bipartite ATP-binding cassette (ABC)-type ATPase domain that preferentially binds and partially unwinds two broken dsDNA termini. The two RAD50 subunits, tethering the broken dsDNA ends bind through the coordination of a unique zinc ion forming the 2xRAD50 homodimer. Formation of the stable 2xMRE11:2xRAD50 core complex is achieved by each unit of the MRE11 dimer binding a RAD50 molecule at the intersection of its globular and coiled-coil domains. Formation of the 2xMRE11:2xRAD50 core ensure the two broken dsDNA termini to remain in close proximity. Each MRE11 subunit contacts a NBN molecule.

Binds to a variety of membrane receptors, such as the extracellular domains of lipoprotein receptors VLDLR (P98155) and LRP8 (APOER2, Q14114), both in a calcium-dependent manner, to Cadherin-related neuronal receptors (CNRs) or to alpha3beta1 integrin (CPX-1797). Receptor binding induces phosphorylation cascades, usually initiated by the phosphorylation of intracellular receptor adaptor protein DAB1 (O75553) or kinase LIMK1 (P53667). Also modulates phosphorylation of TAU (P10636). Eventually, Reelin induces receptor clustering, particularly of VLDLR, and internalization of a Reelin-receptor complex results in Reelin degradation. Reeling-induced signaling affects the dynamics of the actin and microtubular cytoskeleton as well as membrane trafficking through the regulation of the activity of small GTPases. It affects polarization, differentiation, neuronal migration and layer formation in the cerebral cortex, the hippocampus or the cerebellum of the embryonic brain as well as migration of sympathetic preganglionic neurons in the spinal cord, where it seems to act as a barrier to neuronal migration. Also affects neuron growth, maturation, and synaptic activity in the postnatal and adult brain. Abnormal Reelin expression in the brain can cause a range of neurologically-abnormal symptoms, including tremors, ataxia, lissencephaly, cerebellar hypoplasia and malformation of cellular layers throughout the brain and it is implicated in a number of neuropsychiatric disorders including autism, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression and Alzheimer's disease. 	Each Reelin subunit is composed of a signal peptide, an F-spondin-like Reeler domain, a unique region named "H" that is subdivided in three subdomains termed X, Y and Z, eight Reelin-specific repeats (RR1-8), and a positively charged sequence at the C-terminus. APOER2 and VLDLR as well as the calcium ion(s) bind to the central Reelin-specific repeats. Two Reelin subunits that bind each other by way of a disulfide-bond at C2100 and several non-covalent bonds form the basic complex unit. Subsequently, several homodimers form oligomeric supercomplexes.

Primarily acts in monocytes and macrophages. NLRP3 activation is triggered by two sequential signals. The basal level of NLRP3 in macrophages is quite low. Before activation, NLRP3 needs to be “primed” by Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Activation of TLR signaling not only transcriptionally up-regulates NLRP3 expression, but also post-transcriptionally activates NLRP3 by phosphorylation and deubiquitination. The second step, defined as “activation,” can be induced by several potent stimuli such as pore-forming toxins, leading to the oligomerization of NLRP3 and the subsequent assembly of inflammasome. Activating platform for Caspase-1 (CPX-952) through proximity-induced self-cleavage in an ATP-dependent reaction. Activated Caspase-1 cleaves interleukins 1beta (IL1B, P01584) and IL18 (Q14116) releasing the mature cytokines which are involved in a variety of inflammatory processes and is also involved in pyroptosis of macrophages, a special case of cell death, associated with infection by intracellular pathogens where it cleaves GSDMD (P57764). Activation of NLRP3 inflammasome is also required for HMGB1 (P09429) secretion which stimulate inflammatory responses. It belongs to the family of Inflammasomes that includes NLRP1 inflammasome (CPX-4082), NLRC4 inflammasome (CPX-4144), AIM2 inflammasome (CPX-4142) and Pyrin inflammasome (CPX-4143). The expression of NLRP3 and PYCARD is up-regulated in adipocytes from obese patients. Elevation of NLRP3 inflammasome activity has been observed in myeloid cells of patients affected by type 2 diabetes. Moreover, animal models support a role of this complex in multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, gout, Cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes and atherosclerosis. 	The NLRP3 inflammasome is a multimeric protein complex that typically comprises nucleator (NLRP3), adaptor (PYCARD/ASC), and effector (zymogen procaspase-1) subunits. NLRP3 oligomerizes via its NACHT domain and binds the pyrin domain (PYD) of the subunit PYCARD (ASC) with its PYD. This causes PYVARD (ASC) to convert to a prion-like form and generate long PYCARD (ASC) filaments (or specks) that are crucial to inflammasome activation. Pro-caspase-1 then interacts with PYCARD (ASC) through CARD-CARD interactions and forms its own prion-like filaments that branch off of the ASC filaments. The complex has a ring-like organization. 	-	-	Obesity [EFO:0001073]: A status with body weight that is grossly above the acceptable or desirable weight, usually due to accumulation of excess fats in the body.

AIM2 acts as a tumor suppressor. 	The AIM2 inflammasome is a multimeric protein complex that typically comprises nucleator (AIM2), adaptor (PYCARD/ASC), and effector (zymogen procaspase-1) subunits. AIM2 binds dsDNA of viral and bacterial origin through its HIN-200 domain. This event leads to the release of a free pyrin domain (PYD) that recruits the PYD domain of the subunit PYCARD (ASC). This causes PYCARD (ASC) to convert to a prion-like form and generate long PYCARD (ASC) filaments (or specks) that are crucial to inflammasome activation.

MEFV/pyrin protein is associated to the Familial Mediterranean fever. 	The Pyrin inflammasome is a multimeric protein complex that typically comprises nucleator (MEFV), adaptor (PYCARD/ASC), and effector (zymogen procaspase-1) subunits. MEFV binds the pyrin domain (PYD) of the subunit PYCARD (ASC) with its PYD. This causes PYCARD (ASC) to convert to a prion-like form and generate long PYCARD (ASC) filaments (or specks) that are crucial to inflammasome activation. Pro-caspase-1 then interacts with PYCARD (ASC) through CARD-CARD interactions and forms its own prion-like filaments that branch off of the PYCARD (ASC) filaments. Sequence alignment and secondary structure predictions allowed identification of four functional units in human MEFV: a pyrin domain (PYD), a zinc finger domain (bBox), a coiled coil (CC) domain and a B30.2/SPRY domain. By contrast, mouse Mefv (Q9JJ26) also contains the PYD bBox and CC, but lacks a B30.2/SPRY domain. The role of the B30.2/SPRY domain in human MEFV is unclear. Human and mouse Pyrin inflammasomes appear to have similar functions. 	-	-	Familial Mediterranean fever [Orphanet:342]: Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is an autoinflammatory disorder characterized by recurrent short episodes of fever and serositis resulting in pain in the abdomen, chest, joints and muscles.	-	-	-	psi-mi:"MI:0469"(IntAct)

The NPC exclusively mediates all transport between cytoplasm and nucleus. A single NPC in a human cell can transport up to 80 MDa of material within 1 second. The nuclear basket subunits play an active role in transcription, transcriptional memory and chromatin organization by recruiting members of the transcription machinery to the nuclear side of the NCP. 	The nuclear pore complex has a hollow cylindrical shape with eight-fold rotational symmetry along the axis perpendicular to the nuclear envelope. The central channel of the pore has a diameter of ~60 nm diameter. The nucleoporin proteins (NUPs) assemble into several sub-complexes that form higher-order structures called spokes. Eight spokes assemble into larger modules: coaxial outer and inner rings form a symmetric core scaffold, which is connected to a membrane ring, a nuclear basket and cytoplasmic RNA export complexes. The scaffold surrounds a central channel that is formed in part by multiple intrinsically disordered Phe-Gly (FG) repeat motifs that extend from nucleoporins termed FG NUPs. These FG motifs mediate selective nucleocytoplasmic transport through specific interactions with nuclear transport factors, which carry their cognate macromolecular cargoes. There are a total of 32 repeating NUP107 subcomplexes (also known as Y subcomplex) consisting of 10 subunits, NUP37, NUP43, NUP85, NUP96, NUP107, NUP133, NUP160, SEC13, SEH1 and ELYS. They are arranged in four rings of 8 subcomplexes, 2 rings each making up the main components of the nuclear and cytoplasmic rings (NR, CR). Within each CR and NR, there are 2 rings of 8, the inner and outer rings. NRs and CRs have an inner diameter of ~84 nm. The inner ring complex (IRC) consists of NUP35, NUP93, NUP155, NUP188 and NUP205. 32 repeated units are arranged in a head-to-tail fashion into two horizontally stacked rings on each side of the NPC, thereby forming a structure composed of four overlapping rings. The trimeric NUP54-NUP58-NUP62 complex is anchored to the IRC via NUP93. The inner ring harbours the central transport channel and diffusion barrier of the NPC, preventing macromolecules larger than ~40 kDa from freely diffusing across the nuclear envelope. NUP358/RBP2, subcomplex NUP62-NUP88-NUP214, AAAS, NUP98, NUP42/CG1, GLE1 and RAE1 localize to the cytoplasmic side and contribute to the cytoplasmic filaments, whereas NUP50, NUP153 and TPR localize to the nuclear side and form the nuclear basket. Nup98 and RAE1 may occur on the cytoplasmic and nuclear side while NUP62 may occur on the cytoplasmic side and the inner channel. Subcomplex NUP62-NUP88-NUP214 also binds the IRC. NDC1, NUP210 and POM121 are transmembrane NUPs while TMEM33 (P57088) is a putative transmembrane NUP. MW 50-112 MDa. 	-	-	-	-	-	-	psi-mi:"MI:0469"(IntAct)

Primarily acts in monocytes and macrophages. Activating platform for Caspase-1 (CPX-952) through proximity-induced self-cleavage in an ATP-dependent reaction. Activated Caspase-1 cleaves interleukins 1beta (IL1B, P01584) and IL18 (Q14116) releasing the mature cytokines which are involved in a variety of inflammatory processes and is also involved in pyroptosis of macrophages, a special case of cell death, associated with infection by intracellular pathogens where it cleaves GSDMD (P57764). It belongs to the family of Inflammasomes that includes NLRP3 inflammasome (CPX-4141), NLRC4 inflammasome (CPX-4144), AIM2 inflammasome (CPX-4142) and Pyrin inflammasome (CPX-4143). Single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the NLRP1 gene are associated with vitiligo.	The NLRP1 inflammasome is a multimeric protein complex that typically comprises nucleator (NLRP1), adaptor (PYCARD/ASC), and effector (zymogen procaspase-1) subunits. NLRP1 belongs to the family of Nod-like receptors (NLRs), which constitutes 22 members in humans and 34 in mice. The FIIND (domain with function to find) region in NLRP1 is involved in homomerization and autocatalytic cleavage in this region occurs constitutively, prior to activation signals. Once cleaved, N- and C-terminal products remain associated. NLRP1 oligomerizes via its NACHT domain and binds the pyrin domain (PYD) of the subunit PYCARD (ASC) with its N-terminal PYD. In turn, PYCARD (ASC) links procaspase-1 to the complex via CARD-CARD interactions. The complex has a ring-like organization, with an outer diameter of 13 nm and an inner diameter of 4 nm, with density peaks arranged in two concentric rings. The complex is a multimeric structure and the most likely ratio of CASP1:NLRP1:PYCARD is 1:1:1 but 2:1:1 is also a possibility. This complex can be formed without the adapter protein PYCARD (ASC), with lower catalytic activity. In this case, the CARD domain of procaspase-1 binds the CARD domain of NLRP1. 	-	-	Vitiligo [EFO:0004208]: A disorder consisting of areas of macular depigmentation, commonly on extensor aspects of extremities, on the face or neck, and in skin folds.

Composed by binding of the extracellular domains of two presynaptic neurexin proteins and two postsynaptic neuroligin proteins. Expression of both subunits is regulated by neuronal activity. Required for synaptic differentiation, maturation and maintenance, dendritic spine remodelling and axon arborisation. Possibly required for synapse formation. Mediates bidirectional synaptic signalling and coupling of presynaptic, Ca2+-dependent synaptic vesicle exocytosis (= neurotransmitter release) with postsynaptic neurotransmitter receptor recruitment. Acts as a molecular switch between excitatory and inhibitory synapses: this complex acts primarily, but not exclusively, on glutamatergic, excitatory synapses that mainly release neurotransmitters glutamate and aspartate. Mainly found in synaptic clefts of the central nervous system but also at neuromuscular junctions. Mutations in the neuroligin dimer interface as well as allosteric affects of mutation in both subunits affect spacial and fear-associated memory and result in autism-related disorders, mental retardation disorders and schizophrenia. 	Heterotetramer composed of 2 neuroligin and 2 neurexin subunits. Each neurexin monomer binds to opposite sites of the central neuroligin dimer in a Ca2+-dependent manner. The effect of Ca2+ on the intermolecular binding is proposed to be allosteric as Ca2+ does not bind directly to neuroligin residues. The subunits bind to each other via the neuroligin ACHE domain and neurexin LNS domains (LNS6 of alpha-neurexins and sole LNS of beta-neurexins). In mammals, there are 3-5 neuroligin genes and 3 neurexin genes. Neuroligin 4 (= neuroligin X) and neuroligin Y have only been characterised in human, with little information available for neuroligin Y. Neuroligin 1 contains 2 splice sites (SSA & SSB), neuroligins 2 & 3 contain 1 splice site (SSA) and neuroligin 4/X probably contains no splice site. Each neurexin gene produces from independent promoters a longer alpha- and a shorter beta neurexin isoform. Alpha-neurexins contain 5 splice sites (SS1-SS5) and beta-neurexins contain 2 splice sites (SS4 & SS5) which leads to almost 4000 potential neurexin variants alone. The most common variants affecting binding and function are restricted to the presence or absence of neuroligin SSB (restricted to neuroligin 1) and neurexin SS4. These combinations are curated in this resource. N-glycosylation of neuroligin SSB (mainly on Asn300 [count based on NLGN1+SSA+SSB]) reduces binding to beta-neurexin SS4 and abolishes binding to alpha-neurexin SS4 as the intermolecular interfaces are proximal to these respective splice insertions.

Primarily acts in macrophages, monocytes and dendritic cells. Activating platform for Caspase-1 (CPX-952) through proximity-induced self-cleavage in an ATP-dependent reaction. Activated Caspase-1 cleaves interleukins 1beta (IL1B, P01584) and IL18 (Q14116) releasing the mature cytokines which are involved in a variety of inflammatory processes and is also involved in pyroptosis of macrophages, a special case of cell death, associated with infection by intracellular pathogens where it cleaves GSDMD (P57764). NLRC4 inflammasome also induces eicosanoid production. It belongs to the family of Inflammasomes that includes NLRP1 inflammasome (CPX-4082), NLRP3 inflammasome (CPX-4141), pyrin inflammasome (CPX-4143) and AIM2 inflammasome (CPX-4142). Gain-of-function mutations in NLRC4 as the cause of a syndrome of infantile enterocolitis and recurrent macrophage activation syndrome. 	The NLRC4 inflammasome is a multimeric protein complex that typically comprises sensor (NAIP), nucleator (NLRC4), adaptor (PYCARD/ASC), and effector (zymogen procaspase-1) subunits. In absence of a ligand NLRC4 is maintained in an inactive state. Assembly is triggered by NAIP subunit in response to stimuli when NAIP acts as a platform for NLRC4 self-oligomerization. NLRC4 in activated NLRC4-NAIP binds PYD (pyrin domain) of PYCARD (ASC) via its CARD domain. This causes PYCARD (ASC) to convert to a prion-like form and generate long PYCARD (ASC) filaments (or specks) that are crucial to inflammasome activation. Pro-caspase-1 then interacts with PYCARD (ASC) through CARD-CARD interactions and forms its own prion-like filaments that branch off of the PYCARD (ASC) filaments. This complex can be formed without the adapter protein PYCARD (ASC), with lower catalytic activity. In this case, the CARD domain of procaspase-1 directly binds the CARD domain of NLRC4 that is also able to nucleate to form filaments. 	-	-	Macrophage activation syndrome [EFO:1001806]: A serious complication of childhood systemic inflammatory disorders that is thought to be caused by excessive activation and proliferation of T-lymphocytes and macrophages.

Also required for late endosomes/lysosomes biogenesis, it may regulate both the recycling of receptors through endosomes and the MAPK signaling pathway through recruitment of some of its components to late endosomes.	Formed by tightly packed LAMTOR2/3 and LAMTOR4/5 heterodimers wrapped and held together by LAMTOR1, which anchors the complex to the lysosomal membrane by its N-terminal myristoyl and palmitoyl groups. The LAMTOR2/3 heterodimer associates with and serves as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Rag GTPases, whose GTP- bound forms recruit mTORC1 (CPX-503) to the complex.	-	-	-	-	-	-	psi-mi:"MI:0469"(IntAct)

The subunit RANBP2/NUP358 links the SUMO2 E3 ligase complex to the Nuclear Pore Complex (NPC, CPX-873). SUMOylation, mediated by the enzymatic activity of RANBP2, might play a role in the directionality of nucleo-cytoplasmic transport through the nuclear pore.	RANBP2's interaction with RANGAP1 depends on post-translational modification of the C-terminal tail domain of RANGAP1 with the ubiquitin-related modifier SUMO2, and requires the SUMOylated E2 ligase complex (SUMO2) (CPX-3049). The latter forms a molecular glue between SUMOylated RANGAP1 and the internal repeat (IR) region of RANBP2.	-	-	-	-	-	-	psi-mi:"MI:0469"(IntAct)

Cleaves Complement C5 precurser (P01031) into anaphylatoxin C5a (P01031-PRO_0000005988) and Complement C5b (P01031-PRO_0000005985, P01031-PRO_0000005989). Binds host and pathogen cells. C3bBbC3b convertase is more stable than C3bBb convertase (CPX-5601). When bound to the host cell it is readily inactivated by Factor H (P08603), CR1 (P17927) or DAF (P08174) thus preventing autoimmune activation. Combines with C5b, C6 (P13671), C7 (P10643), C8A (P07357), C8B (P07358) & C8G (P07360) and C9 (P02748) to form the Membrane Attack Complex. Lack of protection, due to familial mutations in the complement genes or the presence of autoantibodies against regulators has been linked to atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) and C3 glomerulopathies (C3G) in kidneys and age-related macular degeneration (AMD) in eyes. Conditions of chronic and acute inflammations, as in rheumatoid arthritis, strokes, and heart attacks, become aggravated by complement activation against the disturbed tissue.	The alternative pathway is continuously activated at a low level. C3 precursor is first processed by the removal of 4 Arg residues and spontaneous hydrolysis due to the breakdown of the internal thioester bond forms C3(H2O) (disulfide bonded P01024-PRO_0000005909 & P01024-PRO_0000005908). C3(H2O) subsequently binds factor B that is cleaved by Factor D (P00746) into 2 fragments: CFBa and CFBb. CFBb, a serine protease, then combines with complement factor C3(H2O) or C3b to generate the C3 or C5 convertases. Proteolytic cleavage of C3 to C3b is accompanied by large conformational changes that result in the exposure of cryptic binding sites required for convertase assembly and regulation. This includes a significant movement of the thioester-bond-containing domain through which C3b attaches to target surfaces.

In fluid-phase or when bound to the host cell it is readily inactivated by Factor H (P08603), CR1 (P17927) or DAF (P08174, only on host cells) thus preventing autoimmune activation. Lack of protection, due to familial mutations in the complement genes or the presence of autoantibodies against regulators has been linked to atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) and C3 glomerulopathies (C3G) in kidneys and age-related macular degeneration (AMD) in eyes. Conditions of chronic and acute inflammations, as in rheumatoid arthritis, strokes, and heart attacks, become aggravated by complement activation against the disturbed tissue.	The alternative pathway is continuously activated at a low level. C3 precursor is first processed by the removal of 4 Arg residues and spontaneous hydrolysis due to the breakdown of the internal thioester bond forms C3(H2O) (disulfide bonded P01024-PRO_0000005909 & P01024-PRO_0000005908). C3(H2O) subsequently binds factor B that is cleaved by Factor D (P00746) into 2 fragments: CFBa and CFBb. CFBb, a serine protease, then combines with complement factor C3(H2O) or C3b to generate the C3 or C5 convertases. Proteolytic cleavage of C3 to C3b is accompanied by large conformational changes that result in the exposure of cryptic binding sites required for convertase assembly and regulation. This includes a significant movement of the thioester-bond-containing domain through which C3b attaches to target surfaces.

Manifests as ophthalmoscopically visible yellowish accumulations of protein and lipid that lie beneath the retinal pigment epithelium and within an elastin-containing structure known as Bruch membrane. Occurs in dry and wet forms. Most common cause of irreversible vision loss in the developed world.	-	-	-	psi-mi:"MI:0469"(IntAct)

B12, bound to the carrier protein CBLIF (P27352), docks to the receptor and is then internalized via receptor-mediated endocytosis.	The head of the cubilin trimer is formed by a three-turn intertwined beta-helix, which irreversibly interlocks the three CBN chains. Each trimer is anchored to the apical membrane via docking to a corresponding beta-helix domain of the type-1 transmembrane protein AMN. Ca2+-binding is important for the structural integrity of the CBN trimer by stabilising individual domains (CUB and EGF-like) and/or by mediating interactions between CBN chains.

The EMC extends approximately 200 × 70 × 100 A and has a membrane spanning region composed of twelve hydrophobic transmembrane helices, nine of which form the central ordered core; a basket-shaped hydrophobic vestibule cytosolic region anchored by EMC2 and 9; and an L-shaped lumenal region comprised of EMC1, 4, 7, and 10. The ECM2-9 vestibule can bind to a substrate's transmembrane domain and leads to a lumenally-sealed, lipid-exposed intramembrane groove formed by EMC1, 3, 5 and 6.
